## 🧠 Psychological Marketing Tactics Applied

### 1. **Social Proof**
- Added "Join thousands of event organizers" subtitle
- Subtle but powerful - creates FOMO and trust

### 2. **Value Anchoring**
- **Default to Annual plan** (27% savings) instead of monthly
- Users anchor to highest value first, making other plans seem less attractive
- Shows what they're saving immediately

### 3. **Decoy Effect**
- Basic plan makes Premium look like better value
- Strategic pricing positioning

### 4. **Scarcity & Urgency (Subtle)**
- "Best Value" badges with fire emoji 🔥
- Green "Save up to 27%" banner when annual is selected
- Creates subtle urgency without being pushy

### 5. **Loss Aversion**
- Emphasizes "Unlimited" vs "Limited" features
- Shows what users are missing with visual emphasis on premium features

### 6. **Benefit-Focused Copy**

### 7. **Action-Oriented CTAs**
- ❌ "Choose Plan" → ✅ "Start Basic" / "Get Premium"
- Added arrow icons → Creates sense of forward motion
- More specific and compelling

### 8. **Trust Signals**
- Added trust badge section:
  - 🔒 Secure Payment
  - 🔄 Cancel Anytime
  - ✅ Money-Back Guarantee
- Reduces friction and buyer hesitation

### 9. **Recommended Badge (Subtle Authority)**
- "RECOMMENDED" badge on Premium (replaces "Most Popular")
- More authoritative and professional
- Subtle visual indicator without being aggressive

### 10. **Visual Hierarchy & Attention Direction**
- Premium card is 2% larger (subtle but effective)
- Enhanced shadow on Premium card
