# Event Edit Button Relocation - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The "Edit" button for event admins has been moved from the main single event screen header into the Event Management modal for a cleaner UI and better organization of admin features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Edit Button from Event Header

**File**: `lib/screens/Events/single_event_screen.dart`

**Location**: Main event screen header (around line 4076-4118)

**What was removed**:
- The small "Edit" button that appeared in the top-right corner of the event details section
- This button was visible only to event admins/creators

**Why**:
- Creates a cleaner, less cluttered event header
- Consolidates all admin management features in one location (the Event Management modal)
- Provides better UX by grouping related admin functions together

### 2. Added "Edit Profile" Button to Event Management Modal

**File**: `lib/screens/Events/single_event_screen.dart`

**Location**: Event Management Modal - Quick Actions section (line 1865-1876)

**What was added**:
- New "Edit Profile" button as the first item in the Quick Actions grid
- **Icon**: `Icons.edit_note` (matches the editing nature of the action)
- **Title**: "Edit Profile"
- **Subtitle**: "Event Details"
- **Color**: Purple (`0xFF667EEA`) - consistent with the app's primary color scheme

**Button Configuration**:
```dart
_CompactAction(
  icon: Icons.edit_note,
  title: 'Edit Profile',
  subtitle: 'Event Details',
  color: const Color(0xFF667EEA),
  onTap: () {
    Navigator.pop(context);
    RouterClass.nextScreenNormal(
      context,
      EditEventScreen(eventModel: eventModel),
    );
  },
),
```

## User Experience Flow

### Before
1. User views single event screen
2. Edit button visible in header (if admin)
3. Tap Edit → Go to Edit Event Screen

### After
1. User views single event screen (cleaner header without Edit button)
2. Tap "Event Management" floating action button (if admin)
3. Event Management modal opens
4. "Edit Profile" button is prominently displayed as the first Quick Action
5. Tap "Edit Profile" → Modal closes → Navigate to Edit Event Screen

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner UI**: Main event screen header is less cluttered
2. **Better Organization**: All admin features are grouped in the Event Management modal
3. **Consistent Experience**: Admins access all event management features from one central location
4. **Clear Labeling**: "Edit Profile" is more descriptive than just "Edit"
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: The button follows the same design pattern as other management actions

## Quick Actions Grid Layout

The Quick Actions section now contains (in order):

1. **Edit Profile** - Edit event details (NEW)
2. **Tickets** - Manage tickets
3. **Scanner** - Scan tickets
4. **Attendance** - View attendance records
5. **Sign-In QR** - Share sign-in QR code

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Admin User Flow

1. **Open the app** and navigate to a single event screen where you are the admin
2. **Verify**: The Edit button should NO LONGER appear in the event header
3. **Tap** the "Event Management" floating action button at the bottom
4. **Verify**: The Event Management modal opens
5. **Look at Quick Actions**: The first button should be "Edit Profile" with subtitle "Event Details"
6. **Tap "Edit Profile"**
7. **Expected**: Modal closes and navigates to Edit Event Screen
8. **Make some changes** and save
9. **Expected**: Successfully saves and returns to event screen

### Test Case 2: Non-Admin User Flow

1. **Open the app** and navigate to a single event screen where you are NOT the admin
2. **Verify**: No Edit button appears (this was already the case)
3. **Verify**: Event Management button does NOT appear (this was already the case)

### Test Case 3: Visual Consistency

1. **Open Event Management modal** as an admin
2. **Check**: "Edit Profile" button matches the style of other action buttons
3. **Verify**: Icon, colors, and layout are consistent with the grid design

## Files Modified

- `lib/screens/Events/single_event_screen.dart`
  - Removed Edit button from event header (lines ~4076-4118)
  - Added "Edit Profile" button to Event Management modal Quick Actions (line 1865-1876)

## Notes

- The "Edit Profile" label refers to editing the event's profile/details, not a user profile
- The second instance of EditEventScreen navigation (for "Enable Sign-In Methods") remains unchanged as it serves a different purpose
- The button uses `Icons.edit_note` instead of `Icons.edit` for a more modern look
- Color scheme matches the app's primary purple/blue gradient

## No Breaking Changes

- All existing functionality remains intact
- Only the location and label of the edit button have changed
- Edit Event Screen functionality is unchanged
- All other admin features continue to work as before
