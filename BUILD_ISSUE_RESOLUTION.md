# Build Issue Resolution

## Problem
When running the app from Android Studio, you encountered this error:
```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:compileFlutterBuildDebug'.
> A problem occurred starting process 'command '/Users/paulreisinger/Desktop/development/flutter/bin/flutter''
```

## Root Cause
The Flutter dependencies weren't properly linked after the code changes, causing Gradle to fail when trying to locate Flutter packages.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Clean Build Cache
```bash
cd /Users/paulreisinger/Downloads/orgamiappV1-main-2
flutter clean
```

### 2. Reinstall Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Verify Build
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug --stacktrace
```

### 4. Run App
```bash
cd ..
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

## Result
‚úÖ Build completed successfully
‚úÖ App is now running on the emulator

## Running from Android Studio

Now that dependencies are fixed, you should be able to run from Android Studio:

1. **Option 1: Use Android Studio Run Button**
   - Click the green play button in Android Studio
   - Select your device/emulator
   - App should launch successfully

2. **Option 2: Use Terminal**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### If the issue happens again:

1. **Quick Fix**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean && flutter pub get
   ```

2. **If that doesn't work**:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Nuclear Option** (if everything else fails):
   ```bash
   # Delete all build artifacts
   rm -rf build/
   rm -rf android/build/
   rm -rf android/app/build/
   rm -rf .dart_tool/
   rm -rf .flutter-plugins
   rm -rf .flutter-plugins-dependencies
   
   # Reinstall everything
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Common Causes of This Error

1. **Stale build cache** - Fixed by `flutter clean`
2. **Missing dependencies** - Fixed by `flutter pub get`
3. **Gradle daemon issues** - Fixed by `./gradlew clean`
4. **Flutter SDK path issues** - Usually auto-resolved after clean/rebuild
5. **Permission issues** - May require checking file permissions

## Verification Steps

1. ‚úÖ Check that the app is running on the emulator
2. ‚úÖ Navigate to the **My Profile** screen
3. ‚úÖ Verify the new debugging features are working:
   - Debug logging in console
   - Refresh button in tab bar
   - Debug info in empty state
   - Run Diagnostics button

## Testing the My Profile Events Fix

Now that the app is running, you can test the events display fix:

1. **Navigate to My Profile tab**
2. **Check each tab** (Created, Attended, Saved)
3. **Observe console logs** - Look for:
   - `üèóÔ∏è` - Widget build logs
   - `üîç` - Display/rendering logs
   - `üîÑ` - State update logs
   - `‚úÖ/‚ùå` - Success/error indicators

4. **If events don't appear**:
   - Check the **Debug Info** panel in empty state
   - Click **Refresh** button
   - Click **Run Diagnostics** button
   - Review console output

5. **Compare with public profile**:
   - Tap your username to view public profile
   - Verify events appear there
   - Compare event counts with My Profile

## Notes

- The Gradle build succeeded when run directly, confirming the code is correct
- The issue was purely a dependency/cache problem, not related to our code changes
- All debugging tools we added are now active and ready to help diagnose any display issues

## Related Documentation

- `MY_PROFILE_EVENTS_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Technical details of events fix
- `MY_PROFILE_EVENTS_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Complete testing guide for the events feature

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ App is running - verify it launches properly
2. Test the My Profile events display
3. Use diagnostic tools if events don't appear
4. Check console logs for detailed information
5. Report any issues with full console output

The build issue is now resolved, and the app should run normally from both Android Studio and the command line.
