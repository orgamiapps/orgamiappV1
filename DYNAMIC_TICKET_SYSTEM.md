# Dynamic Ticket System Documentation

## Overview
The Event Ticket section in the SingleEventScreen now dynamically responds to real-time changes in ticket settings made by the event creator. This ensures a seamless user experience when event creators modify their ticketing preferences.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Updates
- The system listens to Firebase document changes for the event
- When ticket settings change, the UI updates automatically without requiring a screen refresh
- Changes are reflected immediately across all users viewing the event

### 2. Dynamic Ticket States

#### When Tickets are **ENABLED**:
- Header shows orange gradient background
- Displays ticket icon (confirmation_number_rounded)
- Shows "Event Ticket" title
- Indicates price or "Free Ticket Required"
- Users can obtain/purchase tickets
- Shows "Obtained" badge if user has a ticket

#### When Tickets are **DISABLED** (Free Entry):
- Header shows green gradient background  
- Displays event icon (event_available_rounded)
- Shows "Event Access" title
- Indicates "Open Event - No Ticket Required"
- Shows "Free Entry" message in content area
- No ticket action buttons displayed
- Existing tickets become invalid

### 3. Automatic State Management
The system automatically handles:
- **Ticket Enable/Disable**: UI switches between ticketed and free entry modes
- **Price Changes**: Updates from paid to free or vice versa
- **Ticket Availability**: Reflects changes in max tickets
- **User Ticket Status**: Clears ticket status when tickets are disabled

### 4. Implementation Details

#### Stream Listener
```dart
// Monitors real-time changes to event document
_eventSubscription = FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection(EventModel.firebaseKey)
    .doc(widget.eventModel.id)
    .snapshots()
    .listen((snapshot) {
      // Check for ticket setting changes
      if (ticketSettingsChanged) {
        // Update UI and re-check user status
      }
    });
```

#### Ticket Status Check
- When tickets are disabled: User ticket status is cleared
- When tickets are enabled: System re-checks if user has a valid ticket
- Prevents errors by checking ticket status before any ticket operations

### 5. User Experience Benefits
- **No Confusion**: Clear visual distinction between ticketed and non-ticketed events
- **Immediate Feedback**: Changes appear instantly without refresh
- **Consistent State**: All users see the same ticket status
- **Graceful Transitions**: Smooth animations between states

### 6. Edge Cases Handled
- Event creator disables tickets after users have purchased
- Switching between paid and free tickets
- Multiple rapid changes to ticket settings
- Network connectivity issues (uses cached data when offline)

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Enable to Disable Tickets
1. Creator has tickets enabled (paid or free)
2. Users can see ticket purchase/get options
3. Creator disables tickets
4. UI immediately shows "Free Entry" status
5. Existing ticket holders see their ticket status cleared

### Scenario 2: Free to Paid Transition
1. Event starts with free tickets
2. Users see "Get Free Ticket" button
3. Creator sets a ticket price
4. UI updates to show "Buy Ticket â€¢ $XX.XX"
5. Header displays the new price

### Scenario 3: Paid to Free Transition
1. Event has paid tickets ($10.00)
2. Creator changes price to $0 (free)
3. UI updates to "Get Free Ticket"
4. Users who paid still have valid tickets

## Color Scheme
- **Orange Theme** (Tickets Enabled): #FF9800, #FFF4E6, #FFEDD5
- **Green Theme** (Free Entry): #10B981, #F0FDF4, #DCFCE7
- **Status Indicators**: Success (#10B981), Info (#6B7280)

## Performance Considerations
- Stream listeners are properly disposed on widget disposal
- State updates are batched to prevent excessive rebuilds
- Conditional rendering prevents unnecessary widget creation
- Lightweight checks before heavy operations

## Security Notes
- Ticket validation happens server-side
- Client only reflects UI state based on server data
- No sensitive ticket data exposed in client state
- Proper error handling for all ticket operations

## Future Enhancements
- Animation transitions between ticket states
- Notification when ticket settings change for registered users
- Historical tracking of ticket setting changes
- Bulk refund handling when switching from paid to free
