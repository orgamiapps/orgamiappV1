# Ticket Design Improvements - Modern Professional Update

## Overview
The ticket card design has been modernized with a cleaner, more professional appearance following current UI/UX best practices for premium event ticketing applications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed "ADMIT ONE" Text
**Rationale:** Modern ticket designs favor clean, minimalist aesthetics. The event title and visual hierarchy convey the ticket's purpose without legacy admission text.

**Before:** Old-style "ADMIT ONE" header in red courier font
**After:** Clean, professional layout starting with branding

### 2. Removed Barcode
**Rationale:** 
- QR codes are the industry standard for event entry
- Barcodes add visual clutter without functional value
- Most modern scanning systems use QR codes exclusively

**Before:** QR code + barcode side-by-side
**After:** Single, prominent centered QR code with enhanced styling

### 3. Added Attendus Logo Badge
**Location:** Top of ticket details section
**Implementation:** Professional pill-shaped badge with:
- AttendUs logo icon (16x16px)
- "AttendUs" branded text
- Purple gradient background with subtle border
- Matches the app's brand color scheme (#667EEA â†’ #764BA2)

**Design Principles Applied:**
- **Hierarchy:** Logo at top establishes brand authority
- **Subtlety:** Translucent gradient doesn't overpower content
- **Consistency:** Uses existing app color palette
- **Modern:** Pill-shaped badges are current design standard
- **Professional:** Tasteful sizing and spacing

## Detailed Changes

### Enhanced QR Code Section

**New Features:**
1. **Centered Layout**
   - QR code now takes center stage
   - Increased size from 80px to 140px for better scanning
   - Better visual balance

2. **Premium Container Styling**
   - Rounded corners (16px radius)
   - Subtle shadow effect
   - 2px border for definition
   - White background with padding

3. **Enhanced QR Code Styling**
   - Square eye shape for modern look
   - Dark color (#1F2937) for optimal scanning

### Logo Badge Implementation

```dart
Container(
  padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 12, vertical: 6),
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    gradient: LinearGradient(
      colors: [
        Color(0xFF667EEA).withValues(alpha: 0.1),
        Color(0xFF764BA2).withValues(alpha: 0.1),
      ],
    ),
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
    border: Border.all(
      color: Color(0xFF667EEA).withValues(alpha: 0.2),
      width: 1,
    ),
  ),
  child: Row(
    children: [
      // 16x16 logo image
      // "AttendUs" text in brand color
    ],
  ),
)
```

**Key Design Elements:**
