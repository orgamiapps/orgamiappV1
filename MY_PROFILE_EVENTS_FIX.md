# My Profile Screen - Events Display Fix

## Problem
The My Profile screen was showing 0 events created, attended, and saved, even though the user had many events in the database.

## Root Cause
The timeout values for Firestore queries were set too aggressively (5-8 seconds), causing the queries to timeout before data could be fetched, especially for users with many events or slower network conditions.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Increased Timeout Values
**Changed from:**
- User data: 5 seconds
- Created events: 8 seconds  
- Attended events: 8 seconds
- Saved events: 8 seconds

**Changed to:**
- User data: 15 seconds
- Created events: 20 seconds
- Attended events: 20 seconds
- Saved events: 20 seconds

### 2. Enhanced Error Visibility
- Added toast notifications when timeouts occur
- Users will now see specific messages like:
  - "Created events loading timed out"
  - "Attended events loading timed out"
  - "Saved events loading timed out"

### 3. Added Diagnostic Logging
- Enhanced debug output showing:
  - User ID and email being used for queries
  - Exact number of events fetched
  - Individual event details when debugging
- Added automatic diagnostics that run when no events are found

### 4. Created Diagnostic Tool
**New file:** `lib/Utils/profile_diagnostics.dart`

This tool automatically runs when the profile shows 0 events and:
- Tests each Firestore query individually
- Measures query performance
- Shows exactly which events exist in the database
- Helps identify if it's a query issue, timeout issue, or data issue

## How to Test

1. **Restart the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Navigate to My Profile screen:**
   - Tap the profile icon in the bottom navigation
   - Wait for the loading indicator

3. **Check for toast messages:**
   - If you see timeout messages, the queries are taking too long
   - This could indicate network issues or too many events

4. **Check debug logs:**
   - Look for lines starting with üîµ, ‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è, or ‚ùå
   - If events are found, you'll see: "Created events count: X"
   - If no events are found, diagnostics will run automatically

5. **Pull to refresh:**
   - Swipe down on the profile screen to manually reload
   - This will retry all queries

## Expected Behavior

### If Events Exist:
- Loading indicator shows while fetching
- Events appear in the appropriate tabs (Created/Attended/Saved)
- Debug logs show event counts and titles

### If Timeout Occurs:
- Toast notification appears explaining which data timed out
- Screen still renders but shows 0 events
- User can pull to refresh to retry

### If No Events Exist:
- Screen shows "You haven't created any events yet" message
- Diagnostics confirm no events in database

## Debug Output to Look For

When navigating to My Profile, you should see logs like:

```
üîµ Starting parallel data fetch...
üîµ User ID: abc123...
üîµ User Email: user@example.com
========================================
MY_PROFILE_SCREEN: Events fetched results:
‚úÖ Created events count: 5
‚úÖ Attended events count: 12
‚úÖ Saved events count: 3
========================================
```

If you see:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Created events fetch timed out after 20 seconds
```

This means the query is taking too long, possibly due to:
- Slow network connection
- Large number of events
- Firestore performance issues

## Additional Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Queries run in parallel for faster loading
- Individual timeouts prevent one slow query from blocking others
- Events are cached after first load for faster subsequent views

### Firestore Query Structure
- **Created events:** Query `events` collection where `customerUid == userId`
- **Attended events:** Query `attendance` collection, then fetch events
- **Saved events:** Query user's `favorites` array, then fetch events

### Troubleshooting

**If events still don't show:**

1. Check if user is properly logged in:
   - Look for "User ID mismatch" warnings in logs
   - Verify Firebase Auth user matches CustomerController user

2. Check Firestore rules:
   - Ensure user has read permission for their own data
   - Check console for permission denied errors

3. Check network:
   - Verify device has internet connection
   - Try on different network if possible

4. Check data integrity:
   - Use Firebase Console to verify events exist
   - Check `customerUid` field matches logged in user

**If you see "All event lists are empty after setState!":**
- Diagnostics will run automatically
- Check the diagnostic output for detailed query results
- This will show if events exist but aren't being fetched properly

## Files Modified

1. `lib/screens/MyProfile/my_profile_screen.dart`
   - Increased timeout values
   - Added enhanced error logging
   - Added automatic diagnostics trigger
   - Improved toast notifications

2. `lib/Utils/profile_diagnostics.dart` (NEW)
   - Diagnostic utility for debugging event loading
   - Tests each query individually
   - Measures performance
   - Shows detailed results

## Next Steps

After applying these fixes:

1. Hot reload the app or restart it
2. Navigate to My Profile screen  
3. Check debug console for detailed logs
4. If issues persist, check the diagnostic output
5. Share debug logs if further assistance is needed

The increased timeouts should resolve the issue for most users. If events still don't appear after 20 seconds, it likely indicates a deeper issue with:
- Firestore security rules
- Data structure in the database
- Network connectivity
- User authentication state
