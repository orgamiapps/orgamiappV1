# Copy firestore-production-tier.rules to firestore.rules when ready for production
```

### Step 2: Deploy Cloud Functions

```bash
# Navigate to functions directory
cd functions

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install firebase-functions firebase-admin

# Return to root
cd ..

# Deploy all new subscription functions

# Or deploy all functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Step 3: Test the App

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Run on emulator/device

### Issue: Plan Selection Not Working
**Solution:** Check console for errors. Ensure SubscriptionService is properly initialized and methods exist.

### Issue: Usage Stats Not Showing
**Solution:** Verify subscription has `tier: 'basic'` and `eventsCreatedThisMonth` fields in Firestore.

### Issue: Monthly Reset Not Working
**Solution:** Deploy Cloud Functions and verify they're scheduled correctly in Firebase Console.
