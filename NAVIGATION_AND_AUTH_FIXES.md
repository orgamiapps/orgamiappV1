# Navigation and Authentication Data Fixes

## Summary
This document describes the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve two critical issues:
1. App crashes when using the back button after navigating through multiple screens
2. Google login user data not appearing properly on initial load

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Navigation Crash with Back Button

**Problem**: 
The app was crashing when users navigated to various screens and then used the back button multiple times, particularly after:
- Navigating to Account Screen (from bottom navigation)
- Opening User Profile Screen (from profile picture button)
- Pressing back button twice

**Root Cause**:
- The navigation stack was being exhausted (trying to pop when no routes left)
- Missing safety checks before popping routes
- No error handling for navigation operations

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **AccountScreen** (`lib/screens/Home/account_screen.dart`):
   - Added `WillPopScope` widget to intercept back button presses
   - Check if navigation can pop before attempting to pop
   - Added safety checks to back button gesture detector
   - Prevent crash by checking `Navigator.of(context).canPop()` before popping

2. **UserProfileScreen** (`lib/screens/MyProfile/user_profile_screen.dart`):
   - Wrapped entire screen with `WillPopScope`
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Changed from `maybePop()` to explicit `canPop()` check followed by `pop()`
   - Added safety checks for both loading and normal states

3. **RouterClass** (`lib/Utils/router.dart`):
   - Added try-catch blocks to all navigation methods
   - Created `safelyPop()` method for safe navigation popping
   - Created `canPop()` method for checking navigation stack state
   - Added error logging for navigation failures

4. **MyApp** (`lib/main.dart`):
   - Added `NavigationObserver` for logging all navigation events
   - Better visibility into navigation stack changes for debugging

### Issue 2: Google Login Data Not Appearing

**Problem**:
When users logged in with Google, their profile information (name, profile picture, event count) would not appear immediately. Sometimes the data would appear after navigating to a few screens.

**Root Cause**:
- AuthGate was setting only minimal user data (uid, email) for immediate navigation
- Full user data was being loaded asynchronously in the background
- Screens were not waiting for or refreshing when user data became available
- No mechanism to trigger UI updates when user data was loaded

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **AccountScreen** (`lib/screens/Home/account_screen.dart`):
   - Added `_ensureUserDataLoaded()` method in `initState()`
   - Checks if user data needs refreshing (empty name, email prefix name, etc.)
   - Calls `AuthService.refreshUserData()` and `aggressiveProfileUpdate()` if needed
   - Shows loading state while user data is being fetched
   - Refreshes data when returning from profile screen

2. **AuthGate** (`lib/widgets/auth_gate.dart`):
   - Now includes `profilePictureUrl` in minimal customer model
   - Enhanced background initialization to:
     - Initialize AuthService
     - Refresh user data from Firestore
     - Run aggressive profile update if data is still incomplete
   - Better logging for tracking data loading progress

3. **AuthService** (already existed, now used more effectively):
   - `refreshUserData()` - Fetches latest data from Firestore
   - `aggressiveProfileUpdate()` - Forcefully updates profile from Firebase Auth
   - `updateCurrentUserProfileFromAuth()` - Updates profile from Firebase Auth user data

## Technical Details

### WillPopScope Implementation

```dart
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async {
    // Check if we can safely pop
    if (Navigator.of(context).canPop()) {
      return true; // Allow pop
    } else {
      Logger.info('Cannot pop, staying on screen');
      return false; // Prevent pop and crash
    }
  },
  child: Scaffold(...),
)
```

### Safe Navigation Pop

```dart
// Before
Navigator.of(context).pop();

// After
if (Navigator.of(context).canPop()) {
  Navigator.of(context).pop();
} else {
  Logger.info('Cannot pop - no routes in navigation stack');
}
```

### User Data Loading

```dart
// Check if data needs refresh
final needsRefresh = user.name.isEmpty || 
                     user.name == user.email.split('@')[0] ||
                     user.name.toLowerCase() == 'user';

if (needsRefresh) {
  // Load from Firestore
  await AuthService().refreshUserData();
  
  // If still incomplete, force update from Firebase Auth
  await AuthService().aggressiveProfileUpdate();
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `lib/screens/Home/account_screen.dart` - Added navigation safety and user data loading
2. `lib/screens/MyProfile/user_profile_screen.dart` - Added navigation safety
3. `lib/Utils/router.dart` - Added error handling and safety methods
4. `lib/widgets/auth_gate.dart` - Enhanced background user data initialization
5. `lib/main.dart` - Added navigation observer for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

### For Navigation Crash:
1. Navigate to Account Screen from bottom navigation
2. Click on profile picture to open User Profile Screen
3. Press back button once - should return to Account Screen
4. Press back button again - should return to Dashboard without crash
5. Try various navigation paths and press back multiple times

### For Google Login Data:
1. Sign out if logged in
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Verify profile picture appears in Account Screen header immediately
4. Verify name appears correctly (not email prefix or "User")
5. Navigate to User Profile Screen and verify all data appears
6. Check that event counts load properly

### Additional Testing:
1. Test with poor network conditions (airplane mode toggle)
2. Test with new Google account (first-time login)
3. Test with existing Google account
4. Test rapid navigation between screens
5. Test back button from various screens

## Prevention Measures

1. **Always use WillPopScope for screens with custom back buttons**
2. **Always check `Navigator.canPop()` before calling `Navigator.pop()`**
3. **Use try-catch blocks in navigation methods**
4. **Ensure user data is loaded before accessing CustomerController.logeInCustomer**
5. **Add null safety checks when accessing user data**
6. **Use the enhanced RouterClass methods for navigation**

## Debugging

If issues still occur:
1. Check logs for "Navigation:" messages to see navigation stack state
2. Check logs for "AuthGate:" messages to see user data loading progress
3. Check logs for "AccountScreen:" messages to see data refresh attempts
4. Enable debug mode to see detailed navigation observer logs

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Navigation**:
   - Always wrap screens with WillPopScope if they have custom back buttons
   - Use `RouterClass.safelyPop()` instead of direct `Navigator.pop()`
   - Use `RouterClass.canPop()` to check navigation state
   - Add error handling to all navigation operations

2. **User Data**:
   - Always check if `CustomerController.logeInCustomer` is null before accessing
   - Implement loading states when fetching user data
   - Use AuthService methods to refresh/update user data
   - Add refresh mechanisms when returning from other screens

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Wrap navigation in try-catch blocks
   - Log errors for debugging
   - Provide fallback behavior instead of crashing
   - Show user-friendly error messages

## Notes

- These fixes are backward compatible and don't break existing functionality
- All navigation still works as expected, but now with safety checks
- User data now loads more reliably and consistently
- The app is more robust against edge cases and race conditions
