## 🔄 Switching to Real Payments Later

### When You're Ready to Monetize

**For App Features (Premium Subscription):**

Must use Apple In-App Purchase (IAP) per App Store guidelines.

```dart
// Change in payment_placeholder_service.dart
static const String PAYMENT_MODE = 'production';

// Then implement:
// 1. Create IAP products in App Store Connect
// 2. Integrate StoreKit 2 or in_app_purchase package
// 3. Replace placeholder calls with real IAP calls
```

**For Event Tickets:**

Continue using Stripe (already implemented, compliant for physical events).
