# Premium Subscription System Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive premium subscription system for your Flutter app that restricts event creation to premium subscribers only. The system is designed with Stripe integration in mind but currently works with free trials for testing purposes.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Subscription Management Service (`lib/Services/subscription_service.dart`)
- **User Subscription Tracking**: Manages premium subscription status in Firestore
- **Premium Status Checking**: Determines if users can create events
- **Trial System**: Currently provides free premium trials for testing
- **Stripe Integration Ready**: Prepared structure for future Stripe payment processing
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses ChangeNotifier for reactive UI updates

### 2. Premium Upgrade Screen (`lib/screens/Premium/premium_upgrade_screen.dart`)
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, gradient-based design showcasing premium features
- **Feature Highlights**: Lists all premium benefits (unlimited events, analytics, etc.)
- **Pricing Display**: Shows $20/month pricing with clear billing information
- **Free Trial**: Currently activates free premium for testing purposes
- **Subscription Management**: Redirects to management screen for existing subscribers

### 3. Subscription Management Screen (`lib/screens/Premium/subscription_management_screen.dart`)
- **Subscription Overview**: Shows current plan status and billing information
- **Management Actions**: Cancel/reactivate subscriptions
- **Billing History**: Prepared for future payment history display
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time subscription status updates

### 4. Event Creation Protection (`lib/screens/Events/premium_event_creation_wrapper.dart`)
- **Premium Gate**: Checks subscription status before allowing event creation
- **Upgrade Prompt**: Beautiful screen encouraging premium upgrade
- **Seamless Flow**: Automatically proceeds to event creation for premium users
- **Feature Education**: Explains premium benefits when subscription is required

### 5. Account Screen Integration
- **Upgrade Button**: Prominent "Upgrade to Premium" button for non-premium users
- **Premium Status**: Shows subscription status for premium users
- **Easy Access**: Quick navigation to subscription management

### 6. Stripe Integration Preparation (`lib/Services/stripe_service.dart`)
- **Payment Processing**: Complete structure for Stripe payment handling
- **Subscription Management**: Create, cancel, and update subscriptions
- **Customer Management**: Handle Stripe customer creation and management
- **Mock Implementation**: Currently returns mock data for testing
- **Production Ready**: Easy to switch to real Stripe integration

## Database Structure

### Subscriptions Collection (`subscriptions/{userId}`)
```javascript
{
  userId: string,           // Firebase user ID
  planId: string,          // 'premium_monthly', 'premium_yearly'
  status: string,          // 'active', 'cancelled', 'past_due', 'incomplete'
  priceAmount: number,     // Price in cents (2000 = $20.00)
  currency: string,        // 'USD'
  interval: string,        // 'month', 'year'
  currentPeriodStart: timestamp,
  currentPeriodEnd: timestamp,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp,
  cancelledAt: timestamp?, // Only if cancelled
  stripeSubscriptionId: string?,  // For future Stripe integration
  stripeCustomerId: string?,      // For future Stripe integration
  isTrial: boolean,        // True for trial subscriptions
  trialEndsAt: timestamp?  // Trial end date
}
```

## Usage Flow

### For Non-Premium Users
1. User attempts to create an event
2. System checks subscription status
3. Shows premium requirement screen with upgrade options
4. User can upgrade to premium or go back
5. After upgrade, user can create unlimited events

### For Premium Users
1. User attempts to create an event
2. System verifies active subscription
3. Proceeds directly to event creation flow
4. No restrictions on event creation

### Account Management
1. Non-premium users see "Upgrade to Premium" button at top of account screen
2. Premium users see their subscription status and management options
3. Easy access to subscription management and billing

## Testing Features

### Current Implementation (Free Trial)
- All subscriptions are currently free for testing
- Users get a 1-year trial period
- Full premium features are enabled
- No actual payment processing occurs

### Stripe Integration Ready
- Complete payment flow structure implemented
- Mock responses for all Stripe operations
- Easy to enable real payments by updating API keys and backend

## Future Stripe Integration

### Backend Requirements
When ready to implement real payments, you'll need:

1. **Backend API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/create-payment-intent`
   - `/api/create-subscription`
   - `/api/cancel-subscription`
   - `/api/update-subscription`
   - `/api/create-customer`
   - `/api/get-customer`

2. **Stripe Configuration**:
   - Update publishable keys in `StripeService`
   - Set up webhook endpoints for subscription events
   - Configure price IDs for your subscription plans

3. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_TEST=pk_test_...
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_LIVE=pk_live_...
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_TEST=sk_test_...
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_LIVE=sk_live_...
   ```

## Security Features

- Server-side validation through Firestore security rules

- Real-time subscription status monitoring
