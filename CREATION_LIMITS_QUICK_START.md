await LimitReachedDialog.show(
  context,
  type: 'event',
  limit: 5,
);
```

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What happens to existing users?**
A: Counts default to 0, they'll see "0/5" until they create more.

**Q: Can premium users see their counts?**
A: Premium users see "Unlimited" instead of counts.

**Q: What if a user deletes an event/group?**
A: Count can be decremented (optional feature to implement).

**Q: How do I change the limits?**
A: Update constants in `CreationLimitService`.

**Q: What about offline mode?**
A: Service continues with cached counts, syncs when online.

## 🎉 That's It!

The system is fully functional and ready for production. Users will now be encouraged to upgrade to Premium after creating 5 events or 5 groups!
