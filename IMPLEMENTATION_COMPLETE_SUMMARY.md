## üéØ Payment Placeholder System

### The Challenge

Your app had a premium subscription system that would violate App Store guidelines if it charged users for app features using Stripe.

### The Solution

Implemented a professional payment placeholder system:

**Features:**
- üçé Apple Pay UI (realistic design)
- üì± Google Pay UI (ready for future)
- üè∑Ô∏è Clear "Demo Mode - No actual charge" badges
- ‚úÖ Grants premium access without charging
- üîÑ Easy to switch to real Apple IAP later

**Implementation:**
```dart
// Shows Apple Pay UI, processes without charging
final success = await PaymentPlaceholderService().showApplePayPlaceholder(
  context: context,
  productName: 'Premium Monthly',
  amount: 4.99,
  currency: 'USD',
);

if (success) {
  // Grant premium features
}
```

**User Experience:**
1. User selects premium plan
2. Apple Pay sheet appears
3. Shows product details + price
4. **"Demo Mode - No actual charge" badge visible**
5. User clicks "Pay with Apple Pay"
6. Processing animation (2 seconds)
7. Toast: "‚úÖ [Demo Mode] Payment successful!"
8. Premium features unlocked

**App Store Compliance:** ‚úÖ
- Not charging for app features
- Clearly labeled as demo
- Professional presentation
- Can add real IAP later
