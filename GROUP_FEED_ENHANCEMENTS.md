## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created
1. `lib/screens/Groups/create_photo_post_screen.dart` - Photo post creation interface
2. `lib/screens/Groups/enhanced_feed_tab.dart` - New unified feed implementation

### Modified Files
1. `lib/screens/Groups/group_profile_screen_v2.dart` - Updated to use enhanced feed and new FAB

### Firestore Structure
Photo posts are stored in the Feed subcollection with the following structure:
```json
{
  "type": "photo",
  "caption": "Optional caption text",
  "imageUrls": ["url1", "url2", ...],
  "authorId": "user_id",
  "authorName": "User Name",
  "authorEmail": "user@email.com",
  "authorRole": "member|admin|owner",
  "createdAt": "Timestamp",
  "likes": ["user_id1", "user_id2"],
  "comments": [],
  "isPinned": false
}
```

### Security Rules
The existing Firestore rules already support member posting:
- Members can create posts in the Feed subcollection
- Authors can update/delete their own posts
- Admins and creators can manage all posts

## Usage

### Creating a Photo Post
1. Tap the FAB button (shows "Create Post" for members, "Manage Group" for admins)
2. Select "Share Photo" from the menu
3. Choose photos from gallery or take new ones with camera
4. Add an optional caption
5. Tap "Share" to post

### Viewing the Feed
- The feed automatically updates in real-time
- Pull down to refresh manually
- Upcoming events appear at the top if any exist
- Posts are sorted by pinned status first, then by creation time

## Future Enhancements
1. **Comments System**: Add commenting functionality to all post types
2. **Rich Text**: Support for formatted text in announcements
3. **Reactions**: Multiple reaction types beyond likes
4. **Media Gallery**: View all group photos in a dedicated gallery
5. **Post Editing**: Allow users to edit their posts
6. **Notifications**: Push notifications for new posts and interactions
7. **Search**: Search functionality within the feed
8. **Hashtags**: Support for categorizing posts with hashtags

## Best Practices
1. **Image Optimization**: Images are automatically compressed to 1920x1920 max with 85% quality
2. **Real-time Updates**: Uses Firestore streams for instant updates
3. **Lazy Loading**: Images are cached and loaded efficiently
4. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
