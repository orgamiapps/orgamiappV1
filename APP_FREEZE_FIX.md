# App Freeze Fix - setState During Build Error

## Problem Identified

The app was freezing and becoming unresponsive due to a **critical Flutter error**: `setState()` or `markNeedsBuild()` called during build phase.

### Root Cause

The `SubscriptionService` and `CreationLimitService` were configured as **lazy providers** in `main.dart`, meaning they were initialized only when first accessed. When widgets accessed these services during their build phase (via `Consumer` or `Provider.of`), the services would initialize and immediately call `notifyListeners()`, which attempted to rebuild widgets that were already in the process of building.

### Error Message

```
❌ ERROR: Flutter Error: setState() or markNeedsBuild() called during build.
This _InheritedProviderScope<SubscriptionService?> widget cannot be marked as needing to build because the framework is already in the process of building widgets.
```

## Solution Applied

### Files Modified

1. **lib/Services/subscription_service.dart**
2. **lib/Services/creation_limit_service.dart**

### Changes Made

**1. Added Flutter Widgets Import**
```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
```

**2. Deferred notifyListeners() Calls**

Wrapped all `notifyListeners()` calls in the `initialize()` and `_loadUserSubscription()` methods with `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback()` to ensure they execute **after** the current build frame completes.

**Before:**
```dart
_isLoading = true;
notifyListeners();  // ❌ Causes setState during build
```

**After:**
```dart
_isLoading = true;
// CRITICAL FIX: Defer notifyListeners to prevent setState during build
WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
  notifyListeners();
});
```

### Why This Works

`WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback()` schedules a callback to run **after** the current frame is rendered, ensuring that:

1. The current build phase completes without interruption
2. State changes happen at a safe time (between frames)
3. No setState/rebuild conflicts occur
4. The app remains responsive

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Clean and rebuild** the app:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Test scenarios**:
   - Launch the app (should load without freezing)
   - Navigate to the Account screen (uses SubscriptionService)
   - Navigate to the Home screen and try creating an event (uses CreationLimitService)
   - Check that all UI updates properly reflect subscription and limit states

## Additional Notes

### Other Potential Issues Addressed

While fixing the main issue, the debug logs also showed:
- **Firestore timeouts**: These are likely network-related and may occur in emulator environments
- **Google Play Services errors**: These are emulator-specific and won't occur on real devices

### Performance Impact

The fix has **zero negative performance impact** because:
- `addPostFrameCallback()` is extremely lightweight
- It only delays notifications by a single frame (~16ms at 60fps)
- Users won't notice any delay
- It actually improves performance by preventing build conflicts

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Never call `notifyListeners()` directly in service initialization** if the service might be accessed during build
2. **Always use `addPostFrameCallback()` for state changes** that occur during lazy provider initialization
3. **Test app startup thoroughly** after adding new lazy providers
4. **Monitor debug console** for setState during build warnings
