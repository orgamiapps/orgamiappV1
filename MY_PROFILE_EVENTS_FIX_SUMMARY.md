# My Profile Events Display Fix

## Issue
Events were not appearing in the My Profile screen's Created, Attended, and Saved tabs, even though the same events were visible on the public user profile screen.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the code, several potential issues were identified:

1. **Data fetching looks correct**: The My Profile screen uses the same Firebase methods as the public profile:
   - `getEventsCreatedByUser(userId)`
   - `getEventsAttendedByUser(userId)`  
   - `getFavoritedEvents(userId: userId)`

2. **User ID source difference**: 
   - Public Profile uses: `widget.user.uid` (passed directly)
   - My Profile uses: `CustomerController.logeInCustomer!.uid` (from global state)

3. **Potential timing issues**: Events might be fetched but not displayed due to:
   - State not updating properly
   - Widget rebuild not triggered
   - Category filters inadvertently filtering out all events
   - Data being cleared after loading

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging
Added comprehensive debug logging in `_buildTabContent()` to track:
- Which tab is selected
- Raw event counts for each tab
- Category filtering effects
- Final sorted event counts

This will help identify where events are being lost in the display pipeline.

### 2. Improved Empty State
Enhanced the empty state widget to display:
- Debug information (User ID, Email)
- Event counts for all three tabs
- Two action buttons:
  - **Refresh**: Manually reload profile data
  - **Run Diagnostics**: Execute comprehensive diagnostics and log results

### 3. Manual Refresh Button
Added a "Refresh" button in the tab bar action buttons that:
- Sets loading state
- Re-fetches all profile data
- Updates the UI

### 4. Visual Feedback
The empty state now shows real-time information about:
- Current user ID (truncated)
- User email
- Event counts: Created, Attended, Saved

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to My Profile** in the app
2. **Check each tab** (Created, Attended, Saved)
3. **If events don't appear**:
   - Click the **Refresh** button in the tab bar
   - Check the debug info in the empty state
   - Click **Run Diagnostics** and check console logs
4. **Review console logs** for detailed information:
   - Look for lines starting with `üîç` (build/display debugging)
   - Look for lines starting with `MY_PROFILE_SCREEN:` (data fetching)
   - Look for error messages or timeout warnings

## Testing Steps

1. **Verify public profile works**:
   - Navigate to your public profile (tap your username)
   - Verify events are visible in Created/Attended tabs
   - Note how many events you see

2. **Test My Profile screen**:
   - Go to My Profile tab
   - Check if the same events appear
   - Compare event counts in tabs

3. **Use diagnostic tools**:
   - If events don't appear, click "Run Diagnostics"
   - Check Flutter console for detailed logs
   - Look for the diagnostic output section

4. **Manual refresh**:
   - Try clicking the "Refresh" button
   - Wait for loading to complete
   - Check if events appear

## Expected Console Output

When viewing My Profile, you should see logs like:
```
üîç _buildTabContent called
üîç selectedTab: 1 (1=Created, 2=Attended, 3=Saved)
üîç Raw events count: 5
üîç createdEvents.length: 5
üîç attendedEvents.length: 3
üîç savedEvents.length: 2
üîç selectedCategories: []
üîç After sorting: 5 events
```

When diagnostics run:
```
========================================
PROFILE DIAGNOSTICS
========================================
User ID: abc123...
User Email: user@example.com
User Name: John Doe
========================================
Testing created events query...
‚úÖ Created events: 5 (234ms)
  - Event Title 1 (ID: evt123)
  - Event Title 2 (ID: evt456)
...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Empty state shows 0 events for all tabs
**Possible causes**:
1. User hasn't created/attended/saved any events yet
2. Firebase query timeout (check for timeout warnings in logs)
3. Permission issues (check Firestore security rules)
4. User ID mismatch (check diagnostic output)

**Solution**: Click "Run Diagnostics" to verify Firebase queries work

### Issue: Events show in public profile but not My Profile
**Possible causes**:
1. Different user IDs being used
2. CustomerController.logeInCustomer is null or outdated
3. State update not triggering widget rebuild

**Solution**: 
1. Compare user IDs in debug info
2. Try manual refresh
3. Check console for UID mismatch warnings

### Issue: Some events missing but not all
**Possible causes**:
1. Category filter is active
2. Events are being filtered by privacy settings
3. Some events failed to load due to timeouts

**Solution**:
1. Check if Filter/Sort is highlighted (clear filters)
2. Check console for individual event fetch errors
3. Try refreshing

## Code Changes Made

### File: `lib/screens/MyProfile/my_profile_screen.dart`

1. **_buildTabContent()**: Added comprehensive debug logging
2. **_buildEmptyState()**: Added debug info display and diagnostics button  
3. **_buildTabBar()**: Added manual refresh button

## Next Steps if Issue Persists

1. **Collect diagnostic data**:
   - Run diagnostics and save console output
   - Note the user ID and email from debug info
   - Take screenshots of empty state

2. **Verify Firebase data**:
   - Check Firebase Console for the user document
   - Verify events exist in Events collection
   - Check attendance records in Attendance collection
   - Verify tickets in Tickets collection

3. **Compare user objects**:
   - Log `widget.user.uid` from public profile
   - Log `CustomerController.logeInCustomer!.uid` from My Profile
   - Ensure they match

4. **Check Firestore rules**:
   - Verify user can read their own events
   - Test queries in Firebase Console directly

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. `initState()` ‚Üí `_loadProfileData()`
2. Parallel Firebase queries fetch:
   - User data
   - Created events
   - Attended events  
   - Saved events
3. `setState()` updates widget state
4. `build()` ‚Üí `_buildProfileContent()` ‚Üí `_buildTabContent()`
5. Events displayed in ListView.builder

### Key State Variables
- `createdEvents`: List<EventModel>
- `attendedEvents`: List<EventModel>
- `savedEvents`: List<EventModel>
- `isLoading`: bool
- `selectedTab`: int (1=Created, 2=Attended, 3=Saved)

### Firebase Methods Used
- `getEventsCreatedByUser(userId)`: Queries Events where customerUid == userId
- `getEventsAttendedByUser(userId)`: Queries Attendance + Tickets collections
- `getFavoritedEvents(userId)`: Gets events from user's favorites array

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Events visible in Created tab (if user has created events)
- [ ] Events visible in Attended tab (if user has attended events)
- [ ] Events visible in Saved tab (if user has saved events)
- [ ] Event counts match between My Profile and public profile
- [ ] Diagnostics run without errors
- [ ] Manual refresh works correctly
- [ ] Debug info displays correct user ID and email
