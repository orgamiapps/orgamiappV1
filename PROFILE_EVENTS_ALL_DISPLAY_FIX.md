# My Profile Screen - Display All Events Fix

## Problem
The My Profile screen was only showing a limited number of events (20) for created, attended, and saved events, even though users had more events in the database.

## Root Causes
1. **Firebase Query Limits**: The queries were limited to fetching only 20 events using `limit: initialLimit`
2. **Display Pagination**: The UI was only showing 20 items initially with `_displayedItemCount = 20`
3. **Performance optimizations** were too aggressive, preventing users from seeing all their events

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Firebase Query Limits
- **Created Events**: Removed the `limit: initialLimit` parameter from `getEventsCreatedByUser()`
- **Saved Events**: Removed the `limit: initialLimit` parameter from `getFavoritedEvents()`
- **Attended Events**: Already had no limit, left unchanged
- **Increased timeouts** from 10 seconds to 15 seconds to accommodate larger data loads

### 2. Updated Display Logic
- **Increased initial display count** from 20 to 100 events (`_displayedItemCount = 100`)
- **Increased pagination size** from 20 to 50 events (`_itemsPerPage = 50`)
- **Added "Show All" button** alongside "Load More" for users to display all events at once

### 3. User Experience Improvements
Users now have three options for viewing their events:
1. **Default View**: Shows up to 100 events initially (covers most users' needs)
2. **Load More**: Loads 50 additional events at a time for gradual loading
3. **Show All**: Immediately displays all events without pagination

## Code Changes

### File: `lib/screens/MyProfile/my_profile_screen.dart`
- Removed `initialLimit` constant
- Updated all Firebase query calls to fetch all events
- Increased `_displayedItemCount` from 20 to 100
- Increased `_itemsPerPage` from 20 to 50
- Added "Show All" button for immediate full display

### File: `lib/firebase/firebase_firestore_helper.dart`
- Fixed field name from 'created_at' to 'eventGenerateTime' (previous fix)
- Added graceful fallback for missing Firebase indexes
- Functions already handle null limit parameter correctly

## Performance Considerations
- **Initial Load**: May be slightly slower for users with many events
- **Memory**: All events are loaded into memory, but modern devices can handle this
- **UI Rendering**: ListView.builder only renders visible items, so performance impact is minimal
- **Progressive Display**: Users can still use pagination if they prefer gradual loading

## Testing
After applying these changes:
1. Restart the Flutter app
2. Navigate to My Profile screen
3. Check all three tabs (Created, Attended, Saved)
4. Verify that all events are accessible either immediately or via Load More/Show All buttons

## Future Improvements
If performance becomes an issue for users with hundreds of events:
1. Implement virtual scrolling with dynamic loading
2. Add server-side pagination with cursor-based fetching
3. Cache events locally for faster subsequent loads
4. Add search/filter to help users find specific events
