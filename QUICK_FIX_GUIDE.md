# Quick Fix Guide - My Profile Events Not Showing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

### Open My Profile
Navigate to your profile (bottom nav bar, profile icon)

### Use the Test Button
Tap the **"Test"** button (bug icon) at the top of the Events section

### Check the Result
A toast message will tell you how many events were found:
- **"Found X events"** → Events exist in database, continue to Step 2
- **"Found 0 events"** → No events for this user, see "No Events Found" below

## 📊 Step-by-Step Diagnosis

### Step 1: Test Button Check
**Tap the Test button and note the result**

#### If "Found 0 events":
- Your events may be associated with a different user account
- OR you haven't actually created any events yet
- **Action:** Verify you're logged in with the correct account

#### If "Found X events" (X > 0):
- Events exist in database ✅
- Problem is in how they're being displayed
- **Action:** Continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Refresh Data
**Tap the Refresh button**
- This manually reloads all event data
- Watch for any toast error messages

#### If events now appear:
- Problem was stale data
- **Solution:** Events should now be visible

#### If events still don't appear:
- Continue to Step 3

### Step 3: Check Debug Console
**Look for error messages in the console**

#### Look for:
- `⚠️ timeout` → Network/Firebase slow
- `❌ Error` → Something failed
- `User ID mismatch` → Authentication issue
- `0 events` in the logs → Query returned nothing

## 🔧 Common Fixes

### Fix 1: User ID Mismatch
```
⚠️⚠️⚠️ WARNING: User ID mismatch!
```
**Solution:** Log out and log back in

### Fix 2: Timeout
```
⚠️ Created events fetch timed out
```
**Solution:** 
- Check internet connection
- Try again in a few moments
- Tap Refresh button

### Fix 3: No Events in Database
```
Test button shows: "Found 0 events"
```
**Solutions:**
- Verify you've actually created events
- Check if you're logged in with the correct account
- Events might be owned by a different user ID

### Fix 4: Events Exist but Don't Show
```
Test shows "Found 5 events" but tabs show (0)
```
**Solution:**
- Tap the Refresh button
- Pull down to refresh
- Check debug console for specific errors

## 📱 What You Should See (Working Correctly)

### Tabs Show Counts
```
Created (5)  |  Attended (3)  |  Saved (2)
```

### Events Display
- List of events appears under the selected tab
- Events show titles, images, dates
- Can tap events to view details

### No Errors
- No red toast messages
- No timeout warnings
- Debug logs show success messages

## ⚠️ What Indicates a Problem

### Empty Tabs
```
Created (0)  |  Attended (0)  |  Saved (0)
```
Plus "You haven't created any events yet" message

### Error Toasts
- "Created events fetch timed out"
- "Error loading created events"
- "User ID mismatch detected"

### Debug Warnings
- ⚠️ Timeout warnings
- ❌ Error messages
- User ID mismatch warnings

## 🎯 What to Report

If the issue persists after trying the fixes above, please provide:

1. **Test Button Result**
   - What did the toast say when you tapped Test?
   - Example: "Found 0 events" or "Found 5 events"

2. **Screenshot**
   - Show the My Profile screen with the tabs

3. **Debug Output** (copy from console)
   - Lines starting with `MY_PROFILE_SCREEN`
   - Any lines with ⚠️ or ❌ or ✅

4. **Steps That Didn't Work**
   - "Tried Refresh button - no change"
   - "Tried logging out/in - same issue"

## 📋 Checklist

Before reporting the issue, please verify:

- [ ] Ran the app in debug mode (`flutter run`)
- [ ] Navigated to My Profile screen
- [ ] Tapped the Test button
- [ ] Noted the result (X events found)
- [ ] Tried the Refresh button
- [ ] Checked for toast error messages
- [ ] Looked at debug console output
- [ ] Verified I'm logged in with the correct account
- [ ] Confirmed I actually have created events

## 🔍 Understanding the Test Results

### Test Shows 0 Events
**Meaning:** No events in database for your user ID
**Likely Cause:** 
- You haven't created events yet
- Events are owned by a different account
- User ID mismatch between accounts

**Next Step:** Verify the user ID in the debug logs matches the account that created the events

### Test Shows X Events (X > 0)
**Meaning:** Events exist in database ✅
**Likely Cause:**
- Timeout loading events
- Error parsing events
- Display/rendering issue

**Next Step:** Check debug logs for timeout or error messages

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always check the Test button first** - It gives immediate feedback
2. **Debug console is your friend** - It shows exactly what's happening
3. **Try Refresh multiple times** - Sometimes data needs a nudge
4. **Log out/in can fix auth issues** - Try it if you see "User ID mismatch"
5. **Screenshot + Debug logs = Quick fix** - Having both helps diagnose faster
