# 🚨 FIX GUEST MODE NOW - 2 Minutes

## The Problem
Guest mode is failing with this error:
```
[firebase_auth/admin-restricted-operation] 
This operation is restricted to administrators only.
```

## The Solution (3 Steps)

### ⚠️ Step 1: Enable Anonymous Authentication (REQUIRED!)

**This is the ONLY thing you need to do to fix this!**

1. **Open**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Select**: Your project (Attendus/Orgami)
3. **Click**: "Authentication" in left sidebar
4. **Click**: "Sign-in method" tab at top
5. **Find**: "Anonymous" in the providers list
6. **Click**: On the "Anonymous" row
7. **Toggle**: Switch to "Enable"
8. **Click**: "Save"

**Visual:**
```
Firebase Console
  → Your Project
    → Authentication (sidebar)
      → Sign-in method (tab)
        → Anonymous (in list)
          → Enable ✅
          → Save
```

### Step 2: Deploy Firestore Rules

```bash
cd /Users/paulreisinger/Downloads/orgamiappV1-main-2
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Step 3: Test Again

1. **Uninstall** the app completely
2. **Reinstall** the app
3. **Launch** the app
4. **Tap**: "Continue as Guest"
5. **Verify**: No errors, events load successfully

## ✅ How to Verify It's Fixed

### In the Console Logs, you should see:
```
✅ Signing in anonymously to Firebase for guest mode...
✅ Anonymous sign-in successful: [some-random-uid]
✅ Guest mode enabled with session: guest_123456789
✅ HomeHubScreen: Query completed, got X organizations
```

### In Firebase Console → Authentication → Users:
- You should see an anonymous user with a random UID
- Provider will show "Anonymous"

### ❌ You should NOT see:
```
❌ Error enabling guest mode
❌ admin-restricted-operation
❌ PERMISSION_DENIED
```

## 🎯 That's It!

The entire fix is just **enabling Anonymous Authentication in Firebase Console**. 

Everything else (code changes, Firestore rules) is already done. You just need to flip that switch in Firebase!
