# Account Screen Back Button Navigation Fix

## Problem
The back button on the account screen was not properly navigating back through the navigation history. When users navigated through multiple screens (e.g., Search → Profile → Account → Analytics), pressing back on the account screen would not take them to the previous screen they were on.

## Root Cause
The account screen had a `WillPopScope` wrapper that was interfering with the natural navigation behavior, and it was showing a back button even when there was no navigation history to go back to.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed `WillPopScope` Wrapper
**File:** `lib/screens/Home/account_screen.dart`

The `WillPopScope` was preventing proper back navigation by interfering with the default pop behavior. Removed this wrapper to allow natural navigation stack management.

**Before:**
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return WillPopScope(
    onWillPop: () async {
      if (Navigator.of(context).canPop()) {
        return true;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    },
    child: Scaffold(...),
  );
}
```

**After:**
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).scaffoldBackgroundColor,
    body: SafeArea(child: _bodyView()),
  );
}
```

### 2. Conditional Back Button Display
**File:** `lib/screens/Home/account_screen.dart`

The back button now only shows when there's actual navigation history to go back to. This prevents showing a non-functional back button when the account screen is accessed via the bottom navigation bar.

**Changes in `_buildProfileHeader()`:**
```dart
Widget _buildProfileHeader() {
  final user = CustomerController.logeInCustomer;
  final canPop = Navigator.of(context).canPop(); // Check if we can navigate back
  
  return Container(
    // ...
    child: Row(
      children: [
        // Only show back button if there's navigation history
        if (canPop) ...[
          GestureDetector(
            onTap: () {
              try {
                Navigator.of(context).pop();
              } catch (e) {
                Logger.error('AccountScreen: Error popping navigation stack', e);
              }
            },
            child: Container(
              // Back button UI
            ),
          ),
          const SizedBox(width: 16),
        ],
        Text('Account', ...),
        // ...
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

## Behavior

### When Accessed via Bottom Navigation
- **Before:** Back button shown but doesn't work properly
- **After:** No back button shown (since there's no navigation history)

### When Navigated To via Push
- **Before:** Back button shown but may not navigate correctly through history
- **After:** Back button shown and properly navigates back through the entire navigation stack

## Example Navigation Flow

**User Journey:**
1. Opens Search screen
2. Navigates to Profile screen
3. Navigates to Account screen
4. Navigates to Analytics screen
5. Presses back → Returns to Account screen ✅
6. Presses back → Returns to Profile screen ✅
7. Presses back → Returns to Search screen ✅
8. Presses back → Returns to previous screen ✅

The navigation stack is now properly maintained, and users can navigate back through their entire history.

## Related Screens

The same pattern is already implemented in other bottom navigation screens:
- **MyProfileScreen** - Already has `showBackButton` parameter and conditional back button display
- **Other screens** - Should follow the same pattern if they're part of bottom navigation

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Navigate through multiple screens that include the Account screen
2. Verify the back button appears when navigating TO the account screen via push
3. Verify the back button does NOT appear when accessing account via bottom navigation
4. Verify pressing back navigates through the complete history

## Technical Details

- The account screen is used in two contexts:
  1. **IndexedStack** (via bottom navigation) - No navigation history
  2. **Push navigation** (via RouterClass.nextScreenNormal) - Has navigation history
- `Navigator.of(context).canPop()` correctly identifies which context we're in
- The back button is only rendered when there's a route to pop to
