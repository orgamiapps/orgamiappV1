# Persistent Login Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive persistent login system for your Flutter app that ensures users remain logged in when they reopen the app, unless they manually log out.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Service (`lib/services/auth_service.dart`)
- **Secure Token Storage**: Uses `flutter_secure_storage` with platform-specific security (Keychain on iOS, EncryptedSharedPreferences on Android)
- **Automatic Session Restoration**: Automatically restores user sessions when the app starts
- **Session Validation**: Validates stored sessions and handles expired or invalid tokens
- **Centralized Auth Logic**: All authentication operations go through a single service
- **Auto-Login Control**: Users can enable/disable persistent login functionality

### 2. Secure Storage Integration
- Added `flutter_secure_storage: ^9.2.2` dependency
- Encrypted storage for sensitive authentication data
- Platform-optimized security settings:
  - iOS: Keychain with first unlock device accessibility
  - Android: Encrypted shared preferences

### 3. Updated Login Flows
- **Email/Password Login**: Updated to use the new AuthService
- **Social Login**: Enhanced to handle Google, Apple, Facebook, and X (Twitter) authentication
- **Session Persistence**: All login methods now automatically save secure session data

### 4. Auto-Login on App Startup
- Modified splash screen to check for existing valid sessions
- Automatic user data restoration from Firestore
- Graceful fallback to login screen if session is invalid

### 5. Enhanced Logout Functionality
- Complete session cleanup on logout
- Secure deletion of stored authentication tokens
- Updated account deletion to properly clear all session data

### 6. User Control Settings
- New **Login Settings Screen** (`lib/screens/Home/login_settings_screen.dart`)
- Users can toggle auto-login on/off
- Clear explanations of security implications
- Accessible from Account Settings

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- All authentication tokens are encrypted at rest
- Platform-native security implementations
- No sensitive data stored in plain text

### Session Management
- Configurable session timeout (default: 30 days)
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- Validation against current Firebase user

### Privacy Controls
- Users can disable persistent login
- Manual logout clears all stored data
- Account deletion removes all traces

## How It Works

### Login Process
1. User authenticates via email/password or social login
2. AuthService validates credentials with Firebase
3. User data is fetched from Firestore
4. Session data is securely stored locally
5. User is navigated to the home screen

### App Startup Process
1. Splash screen initializes AuthService
2. AuthService checks for stored session data
3. If valid session exists:
   - User data is restored from Firestore
   - User is automatically logged in
   - Navigation to home screen
4. If no valid session:
   - User is directed to login screen

### Logout Process
1. User initiates logout from account settings
2. AuthService signs out from Firebase
3. All stored session data is securely deleted
4. User is redirected to login screen

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `lib/services/auth_service.dart` - Core authentication service
- `lib/screens/Home/login_settings_screen.dart` - User control settings

### Modified Files
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added secure storage dependency
- `lib/screens/Authentication/login_screen.dart` - Updated to use AuthService
- `lib/screens/Splash/splash_screen.dart` - Enhanced auto-login logic
- `lib/screens/Splash/second_splash_screen.dart` - Updated social login handling
- `lib/screens/Home/account_screen.dart` - Enhanced logout and added settings link
- `lib/screens/Home/delete_account_screen.dart` - Updated to use AuthService
- `lib/main.dart` - Added AuthService import

## User Experience

### For End Users
- **Seamless Experience**: Open app → automatically logged in
- **Control**: Can disable auto-login if desired
- **Security**: Secure storage with platform-native encryption
- **Privacy**: Clear understanding of what data is stored

### For Developers
- **Centralized Logic**: All auth operations in one service
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Maintainable**: Clean, well-documented code
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new authentication methods

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login Persistence**: Login → close app → reopen → should be auto-logged in
2. **Manual Logout**: Logout → close app → reopen → should go to login screen
3. **Settings Toggle**: Disable auto-login → close app → reopen → should go to login screen
4. **Session Expiry**: Test with modified timeout values
5. **Network Issues**: Test behavior with poor connectivity
6. **Account Deletion**: Ensure all data is properly cleared

## Configuration Options

The AuthService includes several configurable options:

```dart
// Session timeout (default: 30 days)
final sessionAge = DateTime.now().difference(lastLoginTime);
if (sessionAge.inDays > 30) {
  // Session expired
}

// Auto-login can be controlled per user
await AuthService().setAutoLoginEnabled(false);
```

## Security Considerations

- Session data is encrypted using platform-native methods
- No authentication tokens are stored in plain text
- Sessions automatically expire after 30 days
- Users have full control over persistent login
- Complete cleanup on logout and account deletion

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Biometric authentication integration
- Multiple device session management
- Advanced session analytics
- Custom session timeout per user type

---

The persistent login system is now fully implemented and ready for use. Users will enjoy a seamless experience while maintaining full control over their authentication preferences and data security.
