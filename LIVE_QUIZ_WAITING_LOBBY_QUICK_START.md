## Performance Testing

### Frame Rate Check

3. Join waiting lobby
4. Monitor frame rate (should stay at ~60fps)
5. Add multiple participants
6. Ensure no frame drops during animations
```

### Memory Check
```
1. Open Flutter DevTools
2. Navigate to Memory tab
3. Take baseline snapshot
4. Join waiting lobby
5. Wait 5 minutes
6. Take another snapshot
7. Ensure no memory leaks
```

### Network Check
```
1. Use Firebase Console
2. Monitor real-time database connections
3. Check read/write operations
4. Ensure efficient data streaming
5. Verify no excessive polling
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Waiting lobby doesn't appear
```
Solution:
1. Check quiz status is "draft"
2. Verify participant joined successfully
3. Check Firebase connection
4. Look for errors in console logs
```

### Issue: Participant count not updating
```
Solution:
1. Check Firestore stream is active
2. Verify internet connection
3. Check Firebase permissions
4. Restart the stream subscription
```

### Issue: Animations stuttering
```
Solution:
1. Check device performance
2. Close other apps
3. Reduce particle effects if any
4. Check for console warnings
```

### Issue: Bottom content covered by nav bar
```
Solution:
1. Verify MediaQuery.of(context).padding.bottom is used
2. Check device-specific safe areas
3. Test on actual device (not just emulator)
```
