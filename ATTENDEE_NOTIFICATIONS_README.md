# Attendee SMS Notification System

## Overview

The Attendee SMS Notification System allows event hosts to send text messages to previous attendees of their events. This feature is designed with privacy and security in mind, ensuring that event hosts cannot access attendee phone numbers while still being able to send notifications.

## Features

### üîí Privacy-First Design
- **Phone Number Protection**: Event hosts never see attendee phone numbers
- **Secure Messaging**: All SMS are sent through secure channels
- **Transparency**: Complete notification history is logged
- **Consent-Based**: Only attendees with verified phone numbers can receive messages

### üì± User-Friendly Interface
- **Modern UI/UX**: Professional design with intuitive navigation
- **Smart Search**: Find specific attendees quickly
- **Bulk Selection**: Select multiple attendees at once
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live character count and validation

### üìä Analytics Integration
- **Dashboard Integration**: Accessible from Analytics Dashboard
- **Notification History**: Track all sent notifications
- **Attendee Insights**: View attendee engagement patterns

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SMSNotificationService** (`lib/Services/SMSNotificationService.dart`)
   - Handles all SMS-related operations
   - Manages attendee data retrieval
   - Provides notification history
   - Simulates SMS sending (ready for real SMS service integration)

2. **AttendeeNotificationScreen** (`lib/Screens/Home/AttendeeNotificationScreen.dart`)
   - Main interface for managing notifications
   - Two-tab design: Send Notifications & History
   - Professional UI with modern design patterns

3. **Analytics Dashboard Integration** (`lib/Screens/Home/AnalyticsDashboardScreen.dart`)

   - Privacy and security information

### Data Models

#### AttendeeInfo
```dart
class AttendeeInfo {
  final String uid;

  final bool hasPhoneNumber;
  final String? phoneNumber; // Always null for privacy
  DateTime lastAttendedEvent;
  int totalEventsAttended;
}
```

#### NotificationResult
```dart
class NotificationResult {
  final bool success;
  final int sentCount;
  final List<String> missingPhoneNumbers;
  final String message;
}
```
