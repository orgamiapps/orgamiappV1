# Guest Mode Deployment Checklist

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE TESTING - REQUIRED SETUP

### 1. Enable Anonymous Authentication in Firebase Console ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**

**This is the FIRST step and is REQUIRED for guest mode to work!**

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Click **Authentication** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Sign-in method** tab
5. Find **Anonymous** in the providers list
6. Click on **Anonymous**
7. Toggle to **Enable**
8. Click **Save**

**Verification**: You should see "Anonymous" with status "Enabled" ‚úÖ

**If you skip this step, you will get this error:**
```
[firebase_auth/admin-restricted-operation] This operation is restricted to administrators only.
```

### 2. Deploy Updated Firestore Security Rules

Run the deployment script:
```bash
./deploy_guest_mode_fix.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Verification**: Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules to see updated rules

## üì± TESTING CHECKLIST

## üîç EXPECTED LOG OUTPUT

### ‚úÖ Correct Output (Working)
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO: Signing in anonymously to Firebase for guest mode...
‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO: Anonymous sign-in successful: AbCdEf123456
‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO: Guest mode enabled with session: guest_1234567890
üè† HomeHubScreen: Creating Firestore query...
üè† HomeHubScreen: Query completed, got X organizations
```

### ‚ùå Incorrect Output (Not Working)
```
‚ùå ERROR: Error enabling guest mode
Error details: [firebase_auth/admin-restricted-operation]
PERMISSION_DENIED errors in Firestore queries
```

**If you see the error above**: Go back to Step 1 and enable Anonymous Authentication!

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "admin-restricted-operation" error
**Cause**: Anonymous Authentication not enabled in Firebase Console

**Fix**:
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method
2. Enable "Anonymous" provider
3. Clear app data and retry

### Issue: "PERMISSION_DENIED" from Firestore
**Cause**: Either:
- Anonymous auth not enabled, OR
- Firestore rules not deployed

**Fix**:
1. Verify anonymous auth is enabled
2. Deploy Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
3. Clear app data and retry

### Issue: Anonymous user not appearing in Firebase Console
**Cause**: Anonymous sign-in is failing

**Fix**:
1. Check Firebase Console that Anonymous is enabled
2. Check app logs for specific error message
3. Verify Firebase configuration files are up to date

### Issue: Guest can see events but gets errors on sign-in
**Cause**: Firestore rules might not allow write to Attendees collection

**Fix**:
1. Check Firestore rules allow write for `isAuthenticated()`
2. Verify Attendees collection rules specifically
3. Deploy rules and test again

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Guest mode is working correctly when:

- [x] No `admin-restricted-operation` errors
- [x] No `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors in Firestore
- [x] Anonymous users appear in Firebase Console
- [x] Guest banner shows on home hub
- [x] Events and organizations load successfully
- [x] Guest can view event details
- [x] Guest can sign in to events
- [x] Restrictions work (can't create events)
- [x] Account creation flow works
- [x] Guest to user transition is seamless

## üìä MONITORING

### Firebase Console - Things to Check

**Authentication ‚Üí Users**:
- Anonymous users are being created
- Each guest gets a unique random UID

**Firestore ‚Üí Data**:
- Attendance records have anonymous UIDs
- No unauthorized writes by anonymous users

**Firestore ‚Üí Rules**:
- Updated rules are deployed
- `isAuthenticated()` and `isFullyAuthenticated()` functions exist

### App Logs - Look For

**Good Signs ‚úÖ**:
- "Anonymous sign-in successful"
- "Guest mode enabled with session"
- Firestore queries completing successfully
- No permission errors

**Bad Signs ‚ùå**:
- "admin-restricted-operation"
- "PERMISSION_DENIED"
- "Error enabling guest mode"
- Firestore queries failing

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT ORDER

**Follow this exact order:**

1. ‚úÖ **Enable Anonymous Authentication** (Firebase Console)
2. ‚úÖ **Deploy Firestore Rules** (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`)
3. ‚úÖ **Clear app data or reinstall app**
4. ‚úÖ **Test guest mode**
5. ‚úÖ **Verify in Firebase Console**
6. ‚úÖ **Monitor logs**

**DO NOT skip step 1!** Everything else will fail without it.

## üìû SUPPORT

If issues persist after following all steps:

1. Screenshot the error logs
2. Check Firebase Console for any service outages
3. Verify Firebase project settings
4. Ensure you're deploying to the correct Firebase project
