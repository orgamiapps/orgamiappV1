## 📊 Firestore Data Verification

### Check in Firebase Console:

**Comments Location:**
```
Organizations/{orgId}/Feed/{postId}/Comments/{commentId}
```

**Expected Fields:**
```javascript
{
  userId: "abc123",
  userName: "John Doe",
  userPhotoUrl: "https://...",
  comment: "Great photo!",
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  likes: ["userId1", "userId2"]
}
```

**Post Document:**
```javascript
{
  // ... other fields
  commentCount: 5  // Auto-updated
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Comment button does nothing
**Fix:** Check console for errors, verify organizationId and postId are valid

### Comments don't show
**Fix:** Check Firestore rules allow read access, verify network connection

### Can't add comment
**Fix:** Ensure user is authenticated, check write permissions

### Counter shows 0 but has comments
**Fix:** Run migration to add commentCount field to existing posts

### Photo viewer crashes
**Fix:** Verify all image URLs are valid, check network
