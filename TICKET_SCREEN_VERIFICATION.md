),
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### When You Click "My Tickets" Button:
1. **Navigate to MyTicketsScreen**
2. **See list of compact ticket cards** (small cards showing ticket preview)
3. **Tap any ticket** → Opens **modal bottom sheet**
4. **Modal shows**: Large realistic ticket with perforated edges, event image, details
5. **Tap ticket in modal** → **Flips** to show QR code on back

---

## 🔍 What Your Screenshot Shows

Your screenshot appears to show an **old simple ticket details view** with:
- Plain white background
- Simple "Ticket Details" header
- Basic layout with calendar icon, location, person
- Simple QR code at bottom

**This is NOT the modern RealisticTicketCard design.**

---

## 🤔 Possible Causes

### Option 1: Old Cached Build
**Most Likely!** The app may be running an old cached version of the code.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Full rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Option 2: Navigating from Different Place
You might be clicking on a ticket from somewhere else in the app (like from an event screen or notification) that uses an old ticket view.

**Places to check:**
- Clicking ticket from **Event Details Screen**
- Clicking ticket from **Notification**
- Clicking ticket from **Ticket Management** (organizer view)

### Option 3: Platform-Specific Issue
The modern design might not be rendering correctly on your device/emulator.

## ✅ Verification Steps

### Step 1: Clean Rebuild
```bash
cd /Users/paulreisinger/Downloads/orgamiappV1-main-2
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Step 2: Navigate Correctly
1. Open app
2. Go to **Dashboard** (bottom nav)
3. Tap **Profile** tab (far right)
4. Scroll down to find **"My Tickets"** button
5. Tap **"My Tickets"**
6. Tap any ticket in the list
7. You should see the **modern realistic ticket** in a modal

### Step 3: Verify Modal Content
The modal should show:
- ✅ **Realistic perforated edges** (scalloped top/bottom)
- ✅ **Event image** at top
- ✅ **Title with ACTIVE badge**
- ✅ **Icons** for date, location, customer
- ✅ **Perforated divider lines**
- ✅ **Large QR code** at bottom
- ✅ **"Tap ticket to flip"** text
- ✅ **Flip animation** when tapped

## 🔧 If Still Showing Old UI

If after clean rebuild you still see the old UI, please tell me:

1. **Where did you navigate from?**
   - Profile → My Tickets ✅
   - Event screen → Ticket?
   - Notification → Ticket?
   - Other?

2. **What path did you take?**
   - Screenshot the navigation steps

3. **Device info:**
   - Android emulator?
   - iOS simulator?
   - Physical device?

## 📱 The Correct Modern Design

The **RealisticTicketCard** should look like a real concert/event ticket:

```
┌─○─○─○─○─○─○─○─○─○─○─┐  ← Scalloped edge
│   [Event Image]     │
│                     │
├ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─┤  ← Perforated line
│  Title    [ACTIVE]  │
│                     │

│                     │
└─○─○─○─○─○─○─○─○─○─○─┘  ← Scalloped edge
```

With:
- **Realistic shadows**
- **Perforated tear lines**
- **Premium gradient mesh background** (subtle)
- **Flip animation** to see back

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Run**: `flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run`
2. **Navigate**: Profile → My Tickets → Tap ticket
3. **Verify**: See modern realistic design
4. **Report back**: Tell me what you see!

If you still see the old design, take a screenshot of:
- The full navigation path
- The ticket list screen
- The ticket detail modal

This will help me identify where the old UI is coming from!
