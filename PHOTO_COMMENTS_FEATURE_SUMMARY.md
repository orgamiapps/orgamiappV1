## 🔒 Security Recommendations

### Firestore Security Rules

```javascript
// Comments
match /Organizations/{orgId}/Feed/{postId}/Comments/{commentId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  
  allow create: if request.auth != null
    && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid
    && request.resource.data.comment.size() > 0
    && request.resource.data.comment.size() <= 500;
  
  allow update: if request.auth != null
    && request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['likes']);
  
  allow delete: if request.auth != null
    && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```
