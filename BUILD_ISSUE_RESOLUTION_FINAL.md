# Build Issue - Final Resolution

## Problem
When running `flutter run` from the terminal or Android Studio, you encountered:
```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:compileFlutterBuildDebug'.
> A problem occurred starting process 'command '/Users/paulreisinger/Desktop/development/flutter/bin/flutter''
```

## Root Cause
The issue appears to be related to how `flutter run` invokes Gradle and the Flutter build process. The specific error suggests that Gradle is having trouble starting the Flutter command as a subprocess during the `compileFlutterBuildDebug` task.

This is a known issue that can occur due to:
1. Process execution permissions in Gradle
2. Path resolution issues when Gradle calls Flutter
3. Gradle daemon state corruption
4. Environment variable propagation issues

## Workarounds That Work

### ‚úÖ Solution 1: Use the Custom Run Script (RECOMMENDED)

I've created a shell script that builds and installs the app successfully:

```bash
./run_app.sh
```

This script:
1. ‚úÖ Builds the debug APK using `flutter build apk --debug` (which works)
2. ‚úÖ Installs it on the emulator using `adb install`
3. ‚úÖ Starts the app
4. ‚úÖ Provides instructions for attaching Flutter for hot reload

**Usage:**
```bash
# For default emulator (emulator-5554)
./run_app.sh

# For specific device
./run_app.sh YOUR_DEVICE_ID
```

### ‚úÖ Solution 2: Manual Build and Install

If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
# 1. Build the APK
flutter build apk --debug

# 2. Install on emulator
adb -s emulator-5554 install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk

# 3. Start the app
adb -s emulator-5554 shell am start -n com.attendus/com.attendus.MainActivity

# 4. (Optional) Attach Flutter for hot reload
flutter attach -d emulator-5554
```

### ‚úÖ Solution 3: Use Gradle Directly

```bash
# Navigate to android directory
cd android

# Build using Gradle directly
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Navigate back
cd ..

# Install
adb -s emulator-5554 install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

## Why `flutter build` Works But `flutter run` Doesn't

The key difference:
- **`flutter build`**: Runs the build process in the Flutter tool's context, then invokes Gradle
- **`flutter run`**: Passes control to Gradle, which then tries to invoke Flutter as a subprocess

The subprocess invocation is where the issue occurs - Gradle can't properly execute the Flutter command from within its process.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working:
- `flutter build apk --debug` - Builds successfully  
- Direct Gradle builds (`./gradlew assembleDebug`)
- APK installation via `adb install`
- App runs on emulator
- Hot reload via `flutter attach`
- All My Profile events debugging features are active

### ‚ùå Not Working:
- `flutter run` command
- Android Studio "Run" button (uses `flutter run` internally)

## How to Develop with This Workaround

### For Regular Development:

**Option A: Build Script + Attach**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Build and install
./run_app.sh

# Terminal 2: Attach for hot reload
flutter attach -d emulator-5554
```

**Option B: Manual Workflow**
1. Make code changes
2. Run `./run_app.sh` to build and install
3. Use `flutter attach` for hot reload after initial install

### For Quick Iterations (Hot Reload):

```bash
# Do this once
./run_app.sh

# Then attach Flutter for hot reload
flutter attach -d emulator-5554

# Now you can:
# - Press 'r' to hot reload
# - Press 'R' to hot restart
# - Make changes and save to auto-reload
```

## Attempting to Fix `flutter run`

If you want to try fixing the actual `flutter run` issue, try these:

### 1. Clean Everything Thoroughly
```bash
# Stop all Gradle daemons
cd android && ./gradlew --stop && cd ..

# Remove all caches
rm -rf android/.gradle
rm -rf android/app/build
rm -rf android/build
rm -rf build
rm -rf .dart_tool
rm -rf .flutter-plugins
rm -rf .flutter-plugins-dependencies

# Clean Flutter
flutter clean

# Reinstall dependencies
flutter pub get

# Try running
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

### 2. Check Flutter SDK Permissions
```bash
# Ensure Flutter bin directory has proper permissions
ls -la /Users/paulreisinger/Desktop/development/flutter/bin/flutter

# Should show -rwxr-xr-x (executable)
```

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
```bash
# Check Flutter is in PATH
which flutter

# Should output: /Users/paulreisinger/Desktop/development/flutter/bin/flutter
```

### 4. Try Flutter Upgrade
```bash
# Upgrade to latest stable
flutter upgrade

# Then try running
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

### 5. Check Gradle Daemon
```bash
# Check daemon status
cd android && ./gradlew --status

# If there are daemons running, stop them
./gradlew --stop

# Try running again
cd .. && flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

## Testing the My Profile Events Fix

Now that the app is installed and running, test the events display:

1. **Open the app** on your emulator
2. **Navigate to My Profile** tab
3. **Check the three tabs**: Created, Attended, Saved
4. **Monitor console logs**:
   ```bash
   # In a separate terminal
   flutter logs -d emulator-5554 | grep -E "(üèóÔ∏è|üîç|üîÑ|MY_PROFILE)"
   ```
5. **Use the debug tools**:
   - Click **Refresh** button in tab bar
   - Check **Debug Info** panel in empty state
   - Click **Run Diagnostics** button

## Quick Reference

### To Run the App:
```bash
./run_app.sh
```

### To View Logs:
```bash
flutter logs -d emulator-5554
```

### To Enable Hot Reload:
```bash
flutter attach -d emulator-5554
```

### To Rebuild and Reinstall:
```bash
./run_app.sh
```

### To Stop the App:
```bash
adb -s emulator-5554 shell am force-stop com.attendus
```

4. **`MY_PROFILE_EVENTS_TESTING_GUIDE.md`** - Testing guide for events feature

## Summary

- ‚úÖ **The app builds and runs successfully** using the workaround
- ‚úÖ **All My Profile events debugging features are active**
- ‚úÖ **Hot reload is available** via `flutter attach`
- ‚ùå **`flutter run` has an issue** but doesn't block development
- üîß **Use `./run_app.sh`** for the smoothest experience

The workaround is fully functional and allows normal Flutter development with hot reload. The actual `flutter run` issue appears to be an environment or configuration problem that would require deeper investigation, but doesn't prevent you from developing and testing the app.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ App is installed and running
2. Test the My Profile events display
3. Use `./run_app.sh` for subsequent runs
4. Use `flutter attach` for hot reload during development
5. (Optional) Investigate flutter run issue further if needed

Your app is ready for testing! üéâ
