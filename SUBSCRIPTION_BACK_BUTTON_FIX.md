# Subscription Screen Back Button Fix

## Issue Description
The app was crashing or stopping working when clicking the back button multiple times in the subscription management screen. The console showed `WindowOnBackDispatcher` warnings and SSL shutdown errors.

### Error Messages
```
W/WindowOnBackDispatcher: sendCancelIfRunning: isInProgress=false callback=io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity$1@c77e1ee
D/EGL_emulation: app_time_stats: avg=5202.94ms min=1.91ms max=150462.72ms count=29
V/NativeCrypto: SSL shutdown failed: ssl=0xb400006ffbdbfa98: I/O error during system call
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by asynchronous operations (like `_cancelSubscription`, `_reactivateSubscription`, `_schedulePlanChange`) calling `setState()` after the widget had been disposed when users rapidly pressed the back button.

### Problems Identified:
1. **No mounted checks**: Async functions didn't verify if the widget was still mounted before calling `setState()`
2. **Multiple navigation calls**: Rapid back button presses could trigger multiple `Navigator.pop()` calls
3. **Uncontrolled back navigation**: No `PopScope` widget to prevent navigation during loading states

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Mounted Checks to All Async Operations

All async functions now check `mounted` before calling `setState()`:

```dart
Future<void> _cancelSubscription(SubscriptionService subscriptionService) async {
  if (!mounted) return;  // Check before starting
  
  setState(() {
    _isLoading = true;
  });

  try {
    final success = await subscriptionService.cancelSubscription();
    
    if (!mounted) return;  // Check after async operation
    
    // Show toast and handle result
  } catch (e) {
    if (!mounted) return;  // Check in catch block
    // Handle error
  } finally {
    if (mounted) {  // Check before setState in finally
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false;
      });
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Added PopScope Widget for Back Button Control

Both screens now use `PopScope` to prevent navigation during loading states:

```dart
return PopScope(
  canPop: !_isLoading && !_isNavigating,
  onPopInvokedWithResult: (didPop, result) {
    if (didPop) {
      _isNavigating = true;
    }
  },
  child: Scaffold(
    // ... screen content
  ),
);
```

### 3. Added Navigation State Tracking

Added `_isNavigating` flag to track when navigation is in progress:

```dart
class _SubscriptionManagementScreenState extends State<SubscriptionManagementScreen> {
  bool _isLoading = false;
  bool _isNavigating = false;  // New flag
  // ...
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **lib/screens/Premium/subscription_management_screen.dart**
   - Added `mounted` checks to all async operations
   - Added `PopScope` widget
   - Added `_isNavigating` flag

2. **lib/screens/Premium/premium_upgrade_screen.dart**
   - Added `mounted` checks to `_handleUpgrade()`
   - Added `PopScope` widget
   - Added `_isNavigating` flag
   - Added mounted check in `initState` callback

## Functions Updated

### subscription_management_screen.dart:
- `_cancelSubscription()`
- `_reactivateSubscription()`
- `_schedulePlanChange()`
- `_cancelScheduledPlanChange()`

### premium_upgrade_screen.dart:
- `_handleUpgrade()`
- `initState()` callback

## Benefits

1. **Prevents crashes**: Widget state is only modified when the widget is still mounted
2. **Better UX**: Back button is disabled during loading operations
3. **No memory leaks**: Async operations properly check lifecycle state
4. **Cleaner navigation**: Prevents multiple rapid navigation calls

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test rapid back button presses in subscription management screen
2. Test back button during loading states
3. Test back button during dialog operations
4. Verify no console errors appear during navigation
5. Test on both Android and iOS platforms

## Technical Notes

- `mounted` is a built-in Flutter property that indicates if the State object is currently in the widget tree
- `PopScope` is the modern replacement for `WillPopScope` in Flutter 3.12+
- Always check `mounted` before calling `setState()` in async operations
- SSL shutdown errors are normal network cleanup messages and not critical
