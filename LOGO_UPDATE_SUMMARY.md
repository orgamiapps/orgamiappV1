# Logo Update Summary

## Overview
AttendUs now uses a **dual-logo system** to provide the best user experience across different contexts.

---

## Logo Versions

### 1. Logo with Text (`attendus_logo_withText.png`)
**Purpose:** In-app UI elements where branding with text is appropriate

**Used in:**
- ✅ Splash screen (initial app loading screen)
- ✅ Second splash screen
- ✅ Home Hub screen header
- ✅ Home screen header
- ✅ Login screen
- ✅ Forgot password screen

**Code reference:** `Images.inAppLogo`

### 2. Logo Only (`attendus_logo_only.png`)
**Purpose:** App icons, app store listings, and contexts where clean icon is needed

**Used in:**
- App icons for Android (all densities: mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
- App icons for iOS (all sizes from 20x20 to 1024x1024)
- Web icons and favicon
- App Store and Google Play Store listings

**Code reference:** `Images.inAppLogoOnly`

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `lib/Utils/images.dart`
```dart
class Images {
  static const String inAppLogo = 'attendus_logo_withText.png';
  static const String inAppLogoOnly = 'attendus_logo_only.png';
  // ... other images
}
```

**What changed:**
- Changed `inAppLogo` from `'attendus_logo.png'` to `'attendus_logo_withText.png'`
- Added new `inAppLogoOnly` constant for the logo-only version

**Impact:**
- All screens using `Images.inAppLogo` now show the logo with text
- Logo-only version is available via `Images.inAppLogoOnly` for future use

### 2. Updated `replace_logo.sh` Script
**What changed:**
- Script now uses `attendus_logo_only.png` to generate all app icons
- Updated to clarify that in-app logos are configured separately in `images.dart`
- Enhanced output messages to explain the dual-logo system

**Usage:**
```bash
./replace_logo.sh
```

**Requirements:**
- Place `attendus_logo_only.png` in project root (at least 1024x1024 for best quality)
- ImageMagick installed for automatic icon generation (optional)

### 3. Updated `MANUAL_LOGO_REPLACEMENT.md`
**What changed:**
- Complete rewrite to document the dual-logo system
- Added clear instructions for both automated and manual logo updates
- Included code examples for using both logo versions
- Added file structure diagram

---

   - Added `inAppLogoOnly` constant
   - Updated `inAppLogo` to use `attendus_logo_withText.png`

   - Changed all app icon generation to use `attendus_logo_only.png`
   - Updated script messages and documentation

3. **`MANUAL_LOGO_REPLACEMENT.md`**

4. **`pubspec.yaml`**
   - Already contained both logo files in assets (no changes needed)

---

## Screens Automatically Updated

Since all screens reference `Images.inAppLogo`, they automatically switched to the logo with text:

1. **`lib/screens/Splash/splash_screen.dart`** (line 317)
   - Splash screen now shows logo with text

2. **`lib/screens/Splash/second_splash_screen.dart`** (line 450)
   - Second splash screen now shows logo with text

3. **`lib/screens/Home/home_hub_screen.dart`** (line 251)
   - Home Hub header now shows logo with text

4. **`lib/screens/Home/home_screen.dart`** (line 673)
   - Home screen header now shows logo with text

5. **`lib/screens/Authentication/login_screen.dart`** (line 263)
   - Login screen now shows logo with text

6. **`lib/screens/Authentication/forgot_password_screen.dart`** (line 147)
   - Forgot password screen now shows logo with text

---

## Asset Files Required

Both logo files must be present in the project root:

✅ `attendus_logo_withText.png` - Logo with "Attendus" text underneath
✅ `attendus_logo_only.png` - Logo icon only (no text)

Both are already listed in `pubspec.yaml` under assets.

---

## How to Update App Icons

### Automatic (Recommended)
```bash
# Ensure attendus_logo_only.png is in project root
./replace_logo.sh
```

### Manual
Replace icons in these directories using the logo-only version:
- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher.png`
- `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/*.png`
- `web/icons/*.png`
- `web/favicon.png`

---

## Testing Checklist

After updating logos:

- [ ] Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
- [ ] Launch app and check splash screen (should show logo **with text**)
- [ ] Check home hub header (should show logo **with text**)
- [ ] Check app icon on device home screen (should show logo **without text**)
- [ ] Verify login screen shows logo appropriately
- [ ] Test on both iOS and Android if applicable

---

## Future Use

### To use logo with text in new screens:
```dart
Image.asset(Images.inAppLogo, width: 120, height: 120)
```

### To use logo without text in new screens:
```dart
Image.asset(Images.inAppLogoOnly, width: 120, height: 120)
```

---

## Notes

- The dual-logo system provides flexibility for different contexts
- In-app screens use logo with text for better branding
- App icons use logo without text for cleaner appearance
- Both logos are centrally managed in `lib/Utils/images.dart`
- Easy to switch between versions by changing the constant reference
