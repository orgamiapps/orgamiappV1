# My Profile Screen - Complete Fix for All Events Display

## Summary
Fixed the My Profile screen to properly display ALL events that a user has ever created, attended, and saved. Previously, only created events were showing due to multiple issues in the Firebase queries and data fetching logic.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Created Events ✅
**Problem**: Query was using non-existent field 'created_at' instead of 'eventGenerateTime'
**Solution**: 
- Changed orderBy field from 'created_at' to 'eventGenerateTime'
- Added graceful fallback for missing Firebase indexes
- Removed query limits to fetch all events

### 2. Attended Events ✅
**Problem**: Only checking Attendance collection, missing ticket-based attendance
**Solution**: 
- Now checks BOTH Attendance collection AND Tickets collection
- Includes all tickets (not just "used" ones) as attended events
- Combines event IDs from both sources to get complete attendance history
- Increased timeout from 3 to 10 seconds for larger datasets

### 3. Saved Events ✅
**Problem**: Batch queries could fail silently, missing some saved events
**Solution**: 
- Added detailed logging throughout the fetch process
- Implemented fallback to individual fetches when batch queries fail
- Added logic to fetch missing events individually if batch returns incomplete results
- Increased timeout from 2 to 5 seconds for better reliability

### 4. Display Limits ✅
**Problem**: UI was artificially limited to showing only 20 events initially
**Solution**: 
- Increased initial display count from 20 to 100 events
- Increased "Load More" pagination from 20 to 50 events
- Added "Show All" button to display all events at once
- Removed Firebase query limits that were restricting data fetching

## Technical Changes

### Firebase Query Improvements
1. **getEventsCreatedByUser()**
   - Fixed field name: 'created_at' → 'eventGenerateTime'
   - Added fallback for missing indexes
   - In-memory sorting if orderBy fails
   - Removed artificial limits

2. **getEventsAttendedByUser()**
   - Now queries both Attendance and Tickets collections
   - Combines results from both sources
   - Includes all tickets (attended = has ticket)
   - Better error handling and logging

3. **getFavoritedEvents()**
   - Enhanced batch query logic with fallback
   - Individual fetch for missing events
   - Better error handling and detailed logging
   - Increased timeouts for reliability

### UI/UX Improvements
- Shows up to 100 events initially (was 20)
- "Load More" loads 50 at a time (was 20)
- "Show All" button for immediate full display
- Better performance with ListView.builder (only renders visible items)

## Firebase Index Requirements

For optimal performance, create this composite index:

**Collection**: Events
**Fields**: 
- customerUid (Ascending)
- eventGenerateTime (Descending)

The app will work without this index but queries will be slower.

## Testing Checklist

✅ Created Events Tab
- Shows all events created by the user
- Sorted by creation date (most recent first)

✅ Attended Events Tab
- Shows events from Attendance records
- Shows events from Tickets (both used and unused)
- No duplicates between attendance and tickets

✅ Saved Events Tab
- Shows all favorited events
- Handles deleted/missing events gracefully
- Batch queries with individual fallback

## Performance Considerations

1. **Initial Load**: Slightly slower but fetches complete data
2. **Memory Usage**: Minimal impact, modern devices handle hundreds of events
3. **UI Rendering**: ListView.builder ensures only visible items are rendered
4. **Network**: Multiple parallel queries optimize fetching
5. **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation if indexes are missing

## User Experience

Users now have complete visibility of their event history:
- All created events are accessible
- All attended events (via attendance or tickets) are shown
- All saved/favorited events are displayed
- Flexible viewing options (paginated or all at once)
- No artificial limits on data display

## Future Enhancements

If needed for users with thousands of events:
1. Implement cursor-based pagination
2. Add local caching for offline access
3. Virtual scrolling for very large lists
4. Search/filter within each tab
5. Lazy loading with intersection observer
