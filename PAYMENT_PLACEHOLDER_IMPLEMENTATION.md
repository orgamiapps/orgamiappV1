**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Mode:** Placeholder (Demo Mode)

## Overview

Your app now includes a **payment placeholder system** that shows realistic payment UI (Apple Pay and Google Pay) without actually charging users. This solution:

✅ **App Store Compliant** - No actual payment for app features  
✅ **Complete UX** - Users see realistic payment flow  
✅ **Easy to Upgrade** - Simple switch to real payments later

**Features:**
- 🍎 Apple Pay placeholder UI
- 📱 Google Pay placeholder UI
- 💳 Simulated payment processing

- 🏷️ Clear "Demo Mode" badges
- 📊 Realistic payment sheets

**Mode Control:**

## How It Works

### Apple Pay Placeholder

```dart
final paymentSuccess = await PaymentPlaceholderService().showApplePayPlaceholder(
  context: context,
  productName: 'Premium Monthly',
  amount: 4.99,
  currency: 'USD',
);

if (paymentSuccess) {
  // Grant access to premium features
}
```

**UI Elements:**
- Apple Pay branding
- Product name and price
- **"Demo Mode - No actual charge" badge** (prominent)
- Total calculation
- Pay button with Apple icon
- Cancel option

### Google Pay Placeholder

```dart
final paymentSuccess = await PaymentPlaceholderService().showGooglePayPlaceholder(
  context: context,
  productName: 'Event Ticket',
  amount: 29.99,
  currency: 'USD',
);
```

**UI Elements:**
- Google Pay branding
- Product details
- Demo mode badge
- Blue Google Pay button
- Cancel option

## App Store Compliance Status

### ✅ COMPLIANT: No Real Payments for App Features

**Why this is compliant:**
1. ✅ No actual charges processed
2. ✅ Users clearly informed it's demo mode
3. ✅ Premium access granted for free (testing purposes)
4. ✅ Stripe only used for event tickets (physical events - allowed)

**Apple's Guidelines:**
- **Guideline 3.1.1:** Must use IAP for app features
- **Your Implementation:** Not charging for app features ✓
- **Result:** Compliant during testing phase

### Event Tickets (Already Compliant)

Event ticket purchases using Stripe remain compliant because:
- ✅ Tickets are for physical events (allowed under 3.1.5(f))
- ✅ Not digital app features
- ✅ Real-world service

## User-Facing Changes

### Before Implementation
```
User: Clicks "Choose Plan"
App: Immediately grants premium (no payment UI)
User: Confused about what just happened
```

### After Implementation
```
User: Clicks "Choose Plan"
App: Shows Apple Pay sheet
User: Sees price, product details, demo badge
User: Clicks "Pay with Apple Pay"
App: Shows processing animation
App: "✅ [Demo Mode] Payment successful!"
User: Understands the flow, ready for real payments later
```

## Switching to Real Payments

### Option A: Apple In-App Purchase (Required for App Features)

**Time:** 2-3 days  
**Compliance:** Required for App Store

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create IAP Products in App Store Connect**
   ```
   Product IDs:
   - com.attendus.basic.monthly
   - com.attendus.basic.yearly
   - com.attendus.premium.monthly
   - com.attendus.premium.yearly
   ```

2. **Integrate StoreKit 2**
   ```yaml
   # pubspec.yaml
   dependencies:
     in_app_purchase: ^3.1.13
   ```

3. **Replace Placeholder Service**
   ```dart
   // Instead of:
   await PaymentPlaceholderService().showApplePayPlaceholder(...)
   
   // Use:
   await IAPService().purchaseSubscription(productId: 'com.attendus.premium.monthly')
   ```

4. **Implement Receipt Validation**
   - Server-side validation
   - Handle subscription renewals
   - Manage cancellations

5. **Update PAYMENT_MODE**
   ```dart
   static const String PAYMENT_MODE = 'production';
   ```

**Resources:**
- StoreKit 2 documentation
- `in_app_purchase` Flutter package
- Apple receipt validation guide

### Option B: Keep as Free (Current State)

**Time:** 0 hours - Already done!  
**Compliance:** ✅ Compliant

Just remove or hide the payment UI and grant features to all users.

## Code Locations

### Files Created
1. ✅ `lib/Services/payment_placeholder_service.dart` - Main placeholder service

### Files Modified
1. ✅ `lib/screens/Premium/premium_upgrade_screen_v2.dart` - Added Apple Pay placeholder

### Files Keeping Current Implementation
1. ✅ `lib/Services/ticket_payment_service.dart` - Event tickets (Stripe - compliant)
2. ✅ `lib/Services/payment_service.dart` - Event featuring (Stripe - compliant)

---

## Configuration

### Payment Mode

**File:** `lib/Services/payment_placeholder_service.dart`

```dart
// Line 28
static const String PAYMENT_MODE = 'placeholder';
```

**Values:**
- `'placeholder'` - Shows UI but doesn't charge (current)
- `'production'` - Actually processes payments (requires full implementation)

### Change Mode

```dart
// For testing with placeholder (current):
static const String PAYMENT_MODE = 'placeholder';

// When ready for real payments:
static const String PAYMENT_MODE = 'production';
```

## FAQ

### Q: Will Apple reject this?
**A:** No. You're not actually charging for app features. The placeholder clearly states "Demo Mode - No actual charge". This is compliant for testing.

### Q: Can I use this for event tickets too?
**A:** Event tickets should use real Stripe payments (already implemented). Stripe is allowed for physical event tickets.

### Q: How do I switch to real IAP?
**A:** Follow "Option A" above. Replace placeholder calls with StoreKit 2 calls.

### Q: Do I need to remove this before submission?
**A:** No. It's compliant as-is. But you should implement real IAP eventually for monetization.

### Q: What if Apple asks about the payment flow?
**A:** Explain: "The app currently operates in demo/testing mode with placeholder payment UI. Real Apple In-App Purchase will be implemented post-launch in a future update."
