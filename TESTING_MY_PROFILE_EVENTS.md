# Testing My Profile Events Fix

## Quick Test Procedure

### 1. Run the App
```bash
cd /Users/paulreisinger/Downloads/orgamiappV1-main-2
flutter run
```

### 2. Navigate to My Profile
- Open the app
- Go to the "My Profile" screen (bottom navigation bar, profile icon)

### 3. Observe Initial State
- Check if events appear in the tabs
- Look for any toast notifications
- Note the counts shown in tabs: "Created (X)", "Attended (Y)", "Saved (Z)"

### 4. Use Diagnostic Buttons

#### Refresh Button
- Tap the "Refresh" button at the top of the Events section
- This manually triggers a data reload
- Watch for any toast error messages

#### Test Button  
- Tap the "Test" button (bug icon)
- This runs a direct Firebase query
- A toast will show how many events were found
- Check the debug console for detailed results

### 5. Check Debug Console
While the app is running, watch the debug console for messages:

**Look for:**
- User ID information
- Event fetch results  
- Any error or warning messages
- Event counts

**Example good output:**
```
MY_PROFILE_SCREEN: Starting to load profile data
CustomerController User ID: [YOUR_USER_ID]
Firebase Auth User ID: [SAME_USER_ID]
UIDs Match: true
‚úÖ Created events count: 5
‚úÖ Attended events count: 3
```

**Example problem output:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Created events fetch timed out after 15 seconds
‚ùå Error fetching created events: [error message]
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: User ID mismatch!
```

### 6. Try Pull-to-Refresh
- Swipe down on the My Profile screen
- This should also trigger a data reload
- Watch for loading indicators and results

## What to Report

If events still don't appear, please provide:

1. **Screenshot** of the My Profile screen showing the tabs with 0 events

2. **Debug Console Output** - Copy all lines containing:
   - `MY_PROFILE_SCREEN`
   - `Created events`
   - `Attended events`  
   - `Saved events`
   - Any warnings (‚ö†Ô∏è) or errors (‚ùå)

3. **Test Button Results** - What toast message appeared when you tapped the Test button?

4. **Other Profile Screens** - Can you see your events when viewing your profile from a different screen? If yes, how are you accessing it?

## Expected Results

### If Working:
- Tabs show correct counts: "Created (5)", "Attended (3)", "Saved (2)"
- Tapping each tab shows the respective events
- Events display with titles, images, dates, etc.
- No error toast messages
- Debug logs show events were fetched successfully

### If Not Working:
- Tabs show 0: "Created (0)", "Attended (0)", "Saved (0)"
- Empty state message appears
- Possible toast error messages
- Debug logs will show where the issue is:
  - Timeout?
  - Query error?
  - User ID mismatch?
  - No events in database?

## Troubleshooting Steps

### If you see "User ID mismatch" warning:
1. Log out of the app
2. Log back in
3. Try again

### If you see timeout messages:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try the Test button again
3. Check if Firebase is accessible

### If Test button shows 0 events:
1. Verify you actually have created events
2. Check if events appear on other screens
3. Note the user ID shown in debug logs
4. We may need to check the database directly

### If no debug output appears:
1. Make sure you're running in debug mode (`flutter run`)
2. Check if console output is being captured
3. Try running with `flutter run -v` for more verbose output

## Files Modified

All changes are in:
- `lib/screens/MyProfile/my_profile_screen.dart`

Changes are non-breaking and only add debugging features. You can safely revert by checking out the original file if needed.

## Next Steps Based on Results

1. **Events appear correctly** ‚úÖ
   - Issue is resolved, remove the Test button if desired
   
2. **Timeout errors** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Need to investigate network/Firebase connection
   - May need to increase timeout values
   - Check Firebase indexes
   
3. **User ID mismatch** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Authentication issue
   - Need to fix login flow
   - Check CustomerController initialization
   
4. **0 events in database** üìä
   - Events don't exist for this user
   - Or events are associated with wrong user ID
   - Need to check database directly
   
5. **Other errors** ‚ùå
   - Share the specific error message
   - We'll investigate based on the error
