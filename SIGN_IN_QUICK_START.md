## For QA Testers

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Most Secure Sign-In
**Setup:**
1. Create event with "Most Secure" tier
2. Set event location on map

**Test:**
1. Go to event page
2. Click "Sign In"
3. System should check your location
4. If within geofence → Face ID prompt
5. If outside → Error message with distance
6. Verify both checks are required

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Location check happens first
- ✅ Facial recognition only if in geofence
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Success toast on completion

#### Scenario 2: Regular Sign-In (QR Code)
**Setup:**
1. Create event with "Regular" tier
2. Generate QR code

**Test:**
1. Navigate to sign-in flow
2. Tap "Scan QR Code"
3. Point camera at QR code
4. Code should auto-scan

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Camera opens immediately
- ✅ QR code scans automatically
- ✅ Questions screen (if any)
- ✅ Success and redirect to event

#### Scenario 3: Regular Sign-In (Manual Code)
**Setup:**
1. Create event with "Regular" tier
2. Note the event code

**Test:**
1. Navigate to sign-in flow
2. Tap "Enter Code"
3. Modal appears
4. Type event code
5. Submit

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Modal opens smoothly
- ✅ Keyboard appears
- ✅ Validation on empty fields
- ✅ Loading state during submission
- ✅ Success and redirect

#### Scenario 4: All Methods Available
**Setup:**
1. Create event with "All Methods" tier

**Test:**

3. Should see method selector with:
   - Most Secure option
   - QR Code option
   - Manual Code option

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All 3 methods shown
- ✅ Most Secure requires geofence + face
- ✅ Other methods work normally

#### Scenario 5: Anonymous Sign-In
**Setup:**
1. Log out of app

**Test:**
1. Navigate to sign-in flow
